    "* I think we need some data to train our algorithm, especially to identify keywords and features of relevant/irrelevant articles. We can easily collect information from news search! (or Sogol and Sana may be able to provide us some information)\n",

    "### Variables (to determine the best/worst search engine):\n",
    "1. The number of relevant articles among top 20 results\n",
    "    * Give weights for the position of the article? (1st result has more weight and 20th result has less)\n",
    "2. how much specific information the relevant articles contain (general info only or specific info included)\n",
    "    * how well the search engines do for Broad / Specific prompts\n",
    "    * misreporting / underreporting any difference in results?\n",
    "3. dates of the articles (how old the articles are)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques for preliminary screen (removing irrelevent articles):\n",
    "1. keyword evaluation\n",
    "    * Frequency of the keywords OR how many keywords included (Clotilde's function) in the title and content (maybe not the whole content if it's long, we can sample some part for efficiency) - Sana's doc also mentioned Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency Algorithm (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-tf-idf-term-frequency-inverse-document-frequency/)\n",
    "    * Naive Bayes model (similar to spam email detection, we can detect irrelevant articles) - but this needs the keyword statistics (probability) information / training data\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Clustering\n",
    "    * Cluster the articles with similarity and sort out irrelevant articles - also need some training data\n",
    "    * Non-numerical data need to be carefully pre-processed to obtain the clusters we want. For example, usually the words should be mapped to numerical values (maybe there's some python library does the job?)\n",
    "    * From Sana's file, it seems like some engines (if not all) make clusters for their results so they can show different results. We can make our own clusters to gather relevant information.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Next thing to think about / questions:\n",
    "1. How to screen 'biased' information\n",
    "    * Penalize certain keywords such as politics, (we need to consider different things)\n",
    "2. Specific information (Vessel, captain's name, where it happend, what happened)\n",
    "    * How to identify them in the articles\n",
    "    * How to measure/compare the amount of information in an article numerically\n",
    "3. About regional biases, are we actually focus on Vancouver/North West America? Or anywhere in the world?\n",
