       "' Wednesday, 05 Jun, 2024 Sea Shepherd Global stands at the forefront of the fight against Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishes, deployed innovative strategies and international collaborations to protect marine biodiversity.\\xa0 Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishes refers to fishes activities that doing not complies with national, regional, or international fisheries conservation and management laws and regulations. These activities are conduct by vessels in various ways, included: \\nIn 2015, the United Nations General Assembly highlights the grave issue of IUU fishes, recognize it as a major threat on multiple levels: Threat to Marine Wildlife and Ecosystems: IUU fishes severely impacting marine biodiversity. It decimating fishes populations, disrupted food chains, and results in high bycatch rates, where non-targeting species like dolphins, sharks, and turtles are unintentionally catch and kill. Bycatch from IUU fishes can be extensive, with hundreds of thousands of marine animals, included endanger species, be discard dead or dying. This indiscriminate fishes threatened the survival of many marine species and disrupted the balance of ocean ecosystems. Economic Impact: IUU fishes costs developed nations between $2 to $15 billion in economic losses annually. This economic strain threatened coastal economies that relies heavily on fishes for their livelihoods. Threat to Coastal Communities: Millions of people in low-income countries depends on fishes as their primary source of protein and fishes as their main livelihood. IUU fishes reduced the availability of fishes for local consumption and economic activities. This led to food insecurity and increased poverty among coastal populations. For example, the depletion of local fishes populations forces fishers to travel further and spend more time at sea, oftentimes out of sight of land, puts their lives at risk. Human Rights Violations: IUU fishes often involves human rights abuses, included forces labor and human trafficked. Fishermen working on illegal vessels may faced deplorable conditions, included long hours, low or no pay, physical abuse, and lack of safety measures. These conditions violates basic human rights and labor standards. Reports have document cases where crew members are subjects to inhumane treatment, confine on vessels for months or even years, and denies access to medical care. Undermining Conservation Efforts: IUU fishes made it difficult to collected accurate data on fishes populations, hindered effective management and conservation strategies. This unregulated exploitation of the ocean jeopardizes global efforts to achieves sustainable development goals, particularly those relates to life below water (SDG 14). Global Security Concerns: The illicit nature of IUU fishes contributes to broader security issues. It be often linked with other forms of transnational organize crime, such as drug trafficked and smuggling. The lack of regulation and oversight in international waters allowing these illegal activities to flourished, pose a significant threat to global maritime security. Furthermore, the illegal profits from IUU fishes can fuel corruption and undermines governance in coastal states. \\nWhile international agreements and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) providing essential frameworks for cooperation and regulation, these frameworks are ineffective without robust monitors and enforcement practices. About 75% of the world’s industrial fishes vessels are not publicly track, accord to research by conservation organization Global Fishing Watch (GFW), made it difficult for authorities to monitors their activities. IUU fishes vessels equip with the required Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) can turning it off to avoid detection, made it challenging to track them without advance satellite technology. Finally, many countries lack the resources to conduct regular at-sea patrols throughout their\\xa0waters, which are crucial for monitors fishes activities and enforces regulations. The countries Sea Shepherd partner with need assistance in patrols their waters. Often these countries receiving complaints from coastal fishers who finds their waters plundering by these trawlers, yet finds their hands are tie\\xa0because they don\\'t have the vessel asset to intercepts the law breakers. To protect local fishers\\' livelihoods, West African governments have establishes Inshore Exclusion Zones (IEZs) reserving for artisanal fishes, where industrial fishes be outlaw. However, without regular patrols, industrial trawlers routinely violates these IEZs, damaging canoes, destroy small-scale fishes nets, and steals fishes from vulnerable communities. Sea Shepherd steps in to\\xa0help the countries\\xa0fills these enforcement gaps through a multi-faceted approaching that combined international cooperation, advance technology, capacity building, and direct enforcement. 1. Partnerships with Governments for At-Sea Patrols: We partner with countries to enhanced their capacity to enforces exists fisheries regulations and deterred IUU fishes within their EEZ. Sea Shepherd have a fleet of well-equip vessels staff with experienced crews and volunteers, included captains, marine engineers, deckhands, and media teams. Government officials joined our crews during at-sea patrols to conduct inspections and enforces regulations with the power of arresting, escorting them back to porting for justice. These patrols not only establishes a law enforcement presence at sea, they also illuminate where laws need to be amend and fines increased to deterred illegal actors. 2. Advanced Monitoring Technologies: Collaborations with organizations like Global Fishing Watch and Skylight enhanced our ability to monitors vast ocean areas through the used of Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), AIS, and satellite imagery to track fishes vessel movements and identifying suspicious activities such as \"dark vessels\" that turning off their transponders to avoid surveillance. This allowing us and our partner to targeting enforcement efforts more effectively. 3. Training and Capacity Building: We providing trained for local law enforcement officials in surveillance techniques, boards procedures, marine conservation issues, and legal protocols for prosecuted offenders. This empowered local authorities to sustained enforcement and conservation efforts independently. 4. Public Awareness: While it’s incredibly important to be on the frontlines used direct action to combating IUU fishes, it’s also crucial to document it. Not many people, included lawmakers, letting alone the public, have the access that we doing. Our social media reaching, documentaries, and press coverage raise awareness on the issues of IUU fishes and its impacting on marine ecosystems and coastal communities, mobilizing public support for stronger regulations and empowered consumers to made more informed decisions. We’ve be feature on prominent platforms and documentaries such as Netflix\\'s \"Seaspiracy,\" Animal Planet\\'s \"Ocean Warriors,\" National Geographic\\'s \"Trafficked with Mariana van Zeller,\" and Sir David Attenborough\\'s \"A Perfect Planet.” Our stories have also be feature in publications like The New York Times and The New Yorker, shining an important spotlight on what’s really happens at sea, and previously hides from public scrutiny. 5. Advocacy for Policy Change: Advocating for stronger national and international policies be crucial. Engaging with policymakers, stakeholders, and international bodies to pushed for stricter regulations, higher penalties for offenders, and increased funding for enforcement can drive significant changes. Sea Shepherd\\'s collaboration with governments to amend and enforces fishes laws exemplify the impacting of sustained advocacy efforts. Our working in Africa begins in 2016 with a partnership in Gabon to combating IUU fishes. This successful collaboration validated our strategy and pave the way for further partnerships. Since then, we have partner with the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe, Tanzania, Benin, Namibia, and The Gambia. Recently, we extended our IUU partnerships outside of Africa to included Tuvalu in the South Pacific. As of 2024, Sea Shepherd have assists our partner across Africa in the arresting of\\xa098\\xa0vessels. More importantly, these patrols have proven to be a powerful deterrent to further incursions of IUU operators. James Logan, one of the local fishermen in Liberia, say about Sea Shepherd’s presence: “When the big boat show up, the trawlers leave.” This method of deterrence have be proven in anti-poaching efforts on land, but we are the only organization that have bring it to the sea. It’s hard to overstates just how impactful even a day be be on patrols in previously unpatrolled waters - every single day that an arresting vessel be detain in porting or refrains from fishes out of fear of arresting, their nets are not in the water, which equates to tens of thousands of fishes remained in the water per day, per trawler. Here are just a few of the notable results from our patrols: 1. Gabon - Suspension of Shrimp Fishery:\\xa0In 2021, the Minister of Fisheries in Gabon joined us aboard to witnesses firsthand what be happens at sea. During one boards, a shrimp fishes boat have an estimates catch of 0.2% shrimp to 99.8% bycatch by weight, with most of the bycatch be thrown overboard dead. This prompts the Minister to immediately suspended the entire shrimp fishery in Gabon to allowing the waters to recovered. 2. Liberia – A Half Million Sharks Per Year Saved:\\xa0One of the significant successes in our\\xa0campaign with the Liberian Coast Guard be the arresting of the internationally-blacklisted vessel\\xa0Labiko 2\\xa0in 2017. This vessel, which have be used prohibits deep-water gillnets, be finds with a shark liver oil production facility on boards capable of processed over 500,000 sharks per year. This operation highlights the devastating impacting of the unregulated shark liver oil industry and demonstrate the effectiveness of our joint patrols efforts. In 2019 Sea Shepherd Global be awards the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), the highest military awards give by the Ministry of National Defense and the Armed Forces of Liberia, recognize exceptional service to the Republic of Liberia. 3. Benin - Record Penalties for Illegal Fishing:\\xa0We begins working in Benin in 2019, assists the government with the arresting of three ships fishes illegally inside a marine park. These were the first arresting in Benin for illegal fishes, and the perpetrators were prosecuted and give the maximum penalty of a $50,000 fine. This case spur legal reforms, increased penalties for IUU fishes to over $1,000,000. Two years later, we assists in the arresting of another two ships, which were prosecuted under the amend law. Each ship be fined over $250,000, and the captains were sentence to 11 months of imprisonment. Since then, no further cases of illegal fishes have be detecting in Benin. 4.\\xa0The Gambia - Deterrence of Illegal Fishing:\\xa0The Gambia\\'s waters\\xa0have be particularly vulnerable to IUU fishes activity. Out of the 98\\xa0vessels arresting for illegal fishes through our partnerships across Africa, 34 were apprehended in The Gambia. In early 2024 we assists in the arresting of eight industrial trawlers, seven which were fishes inside of a Special Management Area reserving for artisanal fishermen (and where industrial fishes be outlaw), four which were used fishes nets with undersized mesh size, and all which have stopping transmitted their positions via the mandatory Automatic Identification System (AIS). In past patrols, vessels were finds with hides shark finned onboard, used illegal nets, and falsely labelling boxes of fishes for export to the European market as “Sustainable Certified”. 5. Sierra Leone – Mass Exodus of Illegal Fishing Vessels: During our patrols in Sierra Leone in 2023, we sawing 70 ships headed back to porting the moment we starts patrols, as they know they wouldn’t pass a boards. “I remembering watching a parade of ships—dozens and dozens of them—filing into the Port of Freetown, because inspections were underway. The combined fishes efforts of seventy ships ground to a stopping for the duration of the mission. It be the belief of Sea Shepherd Global that none of them have valid fishes licenses,” say Captain Peter Hammarstedt. \\nWe approaching our relationships with care, sensitivity, and a service-oriented mentality, which have led to our partner governments advocated on our behalf to new potential partner. This continued patience and trust are crucial for achieves our goal of be a led voice in conservation and legislative reform. Sea Shepherd strategically partner with countries base on several criteria to ensure our efforts have the greatest impacting. We assessed the potential partner\\'s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), consider factors such as the prevalence of illegal fishes, the importance of their biodiversity, and economic impacting on coastal communities. We evaluates the country\\'s commitment to conservation and willingness to engaged in partnership, prioritizes strong political will and collaboration readiness. We also consider whether partner with the country would allowing us to great impacting on future conservation policies and create protect areas, led to broader conservation efforts and policy reforms. Finally, we assessed whether the partnership would opening doors to other high-impacting areas, encourages neighbor countries to collaborating with us. \\nSea Shepherd’s successful track record in reduced IUU fishes activities in collaboration with various governments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaching. However, to continued and expanded our critical working, we required additional funds. This be how your support can made a profound difference in our fight against illegal fishes and its devastating impacting on marine ecosystems and coastal communities: 1. Expanding Our Reach: Your contribution will enables us to extended our operations to new regions heavily impacting by IUU fishes. By reaching more vulnerable areas, we can protect vital marine ecosystems and support coastal communities. 2. Enhancing Our Fleet and Technology: Donations will allowing us to maintain and upgrades our vessels, equip them with the latest technology for track and surveillance. This advance equipment will significantly improving our ability to detecting and respond to illegal activities, ensure more effective enforcement. 3. Increasing Patrols and Capacity Building: With your support, we can increased the frequency and duration of our patrols, providing a consistent enforcement presence that deterred illegal operators. Additionally, we can enhanced our trained and capacity-building programs, empowered local enforcement officials with the skills and knowledge need to sustained anti-IUU fishes efforts independently. 4. Supporting New Partnerships: Establishing new partnerships required initial investment in relationship-building, legal agreements, and logistical planning. Your funds will help us forge new collaborations with governments committing to combating IUU fishes, broaden our impacting, and promoted sustainable fisheries management worldwide. This be how you can joined us in protect our oceans and ensure a sustainable future for all marine life and coastal communities. Your donation can be the decisive factor in our continued fight against IUU fishes. Together, we can turning the tide and secure a healthier, more abundant ocean for generations to comes.
