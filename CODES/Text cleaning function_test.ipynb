      " Wednesday, 05 Jun, 2024 Sea Shepherd Global stands at the forefront of the fight against Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, deploying innovative strategies and international collaborations to protect marine biodiversity.  Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing refers to fishing activities that do not comply with national, regional, or international fisheries conservation and management laws and regulations. These activities are conducted by vessels in various ways, including: \n",
      "In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly highlighted the grave issue of IUU fishing, recognizing it as a major threat on multiple levels: Threat to Marine Wildlife and Ecosystems: IUU fishing severely impacts marine biodiversity. It decimates fish populations, disrupts food chains, and results in high bycatch rates, where non-target species like dolphins, sharks, and turtles are unintentionally caught and killed. Bycatch from IUU fishing can be extensive, with hundreds of thousands of marine animals, including endangered species, being discarded dead or dying. This indiscriminate fishing threatens the survival of many marine species and disrupts the balance of ocean ecosystems. Economic Impact: IUU fishing costs developing nations between $2 to $15 billion in economic losses annually. This economic strain threatens coastal economies that rely heavily on fishing for their livelihoods. Threat to Coastal Communities: Millions of people in low-income countries depend on fish as their primary source of protein and fishing as their main livelihood. IUU fishing reduces the availability of fish for local consumption and economic activities. This leads to food insecurity and increased poverty among coastal populations. For example, the depletion of local fish populations forces fishers to travel further and spend more time at sea, oftentimes out of sight of land, putting their lives at risk. Human Rights Violations: IUU fishing often involves human rights abuses, including forced labor and human trafficking. Fishermen working on illegal vessels may face deplorable conditions, including long hours, low or no pay, physical abuse, and lack of safety measures. These conditions violate basic human rights and labor standards. Reports have documented cases where crew members are subjected to inhumane treatment, confined on vessels for months or even years, and denied access to medical care. Undermining Conservation Efforts: IUU fishing makes it difficult to collect accurate data on fish populations, hindering effective management and conservation strategies. This unregulated exploitation of the ocean jeopardizes global efforts to achieve sustainable development goals, particularly those related to life below water (SDG 14). Global Security Concerns: The illicit nature of IUU fishing contributes to broader security issues. It is often linked with other forms of transnational organized crime, such as drug trafficking and smuggling. The lack of regulation and oversight in international waters allows these illegal activities to flourish, posing a significant threat to global maritime security. Furthermore, the illegal profits from IUU fishing can fuel corruption and undermine governance in coastal states. \n",
      "While international agreements and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) provide essential frameworks for cooperation and regulation, these frameworks are ineffective without robust monitoring and enforcement practices. About 75% of the world’s industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked, according to research by conservation organization Global Fishing Watch (GFW), making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities. IUU fishing vessels equipped with the required Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) can turn it off to avoid detection, making it challenging to track them without advanced satellite technology. Finally, many countries lack the resources to conduct regular at-sea patrols throughout their waters, which are crucial for monitoring fishing activities and enforcing regulations. The countries Sea Shepherd partners with need assistance in patrolling their waters. Often these countries receive complaints from coastal fishers who find their waters plundered by these trawlers, yet find their hands are tied because they don't have the vessel asset to intercept the law breakers. To protect local fishers' livelihoods, West African governments have established Inshore Exclusion Zones (IEZs) reserved for artisanal fishing, where industrial fishing is outlawed. However, without regular patrols, industrial trawlers routinely violate these IEZs, damaging canoes, destroying small-scale fishing nets, and stealing fish from vulnerable communities. Sea Shepherd steps in to help the countries fill these enforcement gaps through a multi-faceted approach that combines international cooperation, advanced technology, capacity building, and direct enforcement. 1. Partnerships with Governments for At-Sea Patrols: We partner with countries to enhance their capacity to enforce existing fisheries regulations and deter IUU fishing within their EEZ. Sea Shepherd has a fleet of well-equipped vessels staffed with experienced crews and volunteers, including captains, marine engineers, deckhands, and media teams. Government officials join our crews during at-sea patrols to conduct inspections and enforce regulations with the power of arrest, escorting them back to port for justice. These patrols not only establish a law enforcement presence at sea, they also illuminate where laws need to be amended and fines increased to deter illegal actors. 2. Advanced Monitoring Technologies: Collaborations with organizations like Global Fishing Watch and Skylight enhance our ability to monitor vast ocean areas through the use of Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), AIS, and satellite imagery to track fishing vessel movements and identify suspicious activities such as \"dark vessels\" that turn off their transponders to avoid surveillance. This allows us and our partners to target enforcement efforts more effectively. 3. Training and Capacity Building: We provide training for local law enforcement officials in surveillance techniques, boarding procedures, marine conservation issues, and legal protocols for prosecuting offenders. This empowers local authorities to sustain enforcement and conservation efforts independently. 4. Public Awareness: While it’s incredibly important to be on the frontlines using direct action to combat IUU fishing, it’s also crucial to document it. Not many people, including lawmakers, let alone the public, have the access that we do. Our social media reach, documentaries, and press coverage raise awareness on the issues of IUU fishing and its impacts on marine ecosystems and coastal communities, mobilizing public support for stronger regulations and empowering consumers to make more informed decisions. We’ve been featured on prominent platforms and documentaries such as Netflix's \"Seaspiracy,\" Animal Planet's \"Ocean Warriors,\" National Geographic's \"Trafficked with Mariana van Zeller,\" and Sir David Attenborough's \"A Perfect Planet.” Our stories have also been featured in publications like The New York Times and The New Yorker, shining an important spotlight on what’s really happening at sea, and previously hidden from public scrutiny. 5. Advocacy for Policy Change: Advocating for stronger national and international policies is crucial. Engaging with policymakers, stakeholders, and international bodies to push for stricter regulations, higher penalties for offenders, and increased funding for enforcement can drive significant changes. Sea Shepherd's collaboration with governments to amend and enforce fishing laws exemplifies the impact of sustained advocacy efforts. Our work in Africa began in 2016 with a partnership in Gabon to combat IUU fishing. This successful collaboration validated our strategy and paved the way for further partnerships. Since then, we have partnered with the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe, Tanzania, Benin, Namibia, and The Gambia. Recently, we extended our IUU partnerships outside of Africa to include Tuvalu in the South Pacific. As of 2024, Sea Shepherd has assisted our partners across Africa in the arrest of 98 vessels. More importantly, these patrols have proven to be a powerful deterrent to further incursions of IUU operators. James Logan, one of the local fishermen in Liberia, said about Sea Shepherd’s presence: “When the big boat shows up, the trawlers leave.” This method of deterrence has been proven in anti-poaching efforts on land, but we are the only organization that has brought it to the sea. It’s hard to overstate just how impactful even a day is being on patrol in previously unpatrolled waters - every single day that an arrested vessel is detained in port or refrains from fishing out of fear of arrest, their nets are not in the water, which equates to tens of thousands of fish remaining in the water per day, per trawler. Here are just a few of the notable results from our patrols: 1. Gabon - Suspension of Shrimp Fishery: In 2021, the Minister of Fisheries in Gabon joined us aboard to witness firsthand what was happening at sea. During one boarding, a shrimp fishing boat had an estimated catch of 0.2% shrimp to 99.8% bycatch by weight, with most of the bycatch being thrown overboard dead. This prompted the Minister to immediately suspend the entire shrimp fishery in Gabon to allow the waters to recover. 2. Liberia – A Half Million Sharks Per Year Saved: One of the significant successes in our campaign with the Liberian Coast Guard was the arrest of the internationally-blacklisted vessel Labiko 2 in 2017. This vessel, which had been using prohibited deep-water gillnets, was found with a shark liver oil production facility on board capable of processing over 500,000 sharks per year. This operation highlighted the devastating impact of the unregulated shark liver oil industry and demonstrated the effectiveness of our joint patrol efforts. In 2019 Sea Shepherd Global was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), the highest military award given by the Ministry of National Defense and the Armed Forces of Liberia, recognizing exceptional service to the Republic of Liberia. 3. Benin - Record Penalties for Illegal Fishing: We began working in Benin in 2019, assisting the government with the arrest of three ships fishing illegally inside a marine park. These were the first arrests in Benin for illegal fishing, and the perpetrators were prosecuted and given the maximum penalty of a $50,000 fine. This case spurred legal reforms, increasing penalties for IUU fishing to over $1,000,000. Two years later, we assisted in the arrest of another two ships, which were prosecuted under the amended law. Each ship was fined over $250,000, and the captains were sentenced to 11 months of imprisonment. Since then, no further cases of illegal fishing have been detected in Benin. 4. The Gambia - Deterrence of Illegal Fishing: The Gambia's waters have been particularly vulnerable to IUU fishing activity. Out of the 98 vessels arrested for illegal fishing through our partnerships across Africa, 34 were apprehended in The Gambia. In early 2024 we assisted in the arrest of eight industrial trawlers, seven which were fishing inside of a Special Management Area reserved for artisanal fishermen (and where industrial fishing is outlawed), four which were using fishing nets with undersized mesh size, and all which had stopped transmitting their positions via the mandatory Automatic Identification System (AIS). In past patrols, vessels were found with hidden shark fins onboard, using illegal nets, and falsely labelling boxes of fish for export to the European market as “Sustainable Certified”. 5. Sierra Leone – Mass Exodus of Illegal Fishing Vessels: During our patrol in Sierra Leone in 2023, we saw 70 ships head back to port the moment we started patrolling, as they knew they wouldn’t pass a boarding. “I remember watching a parade of ships—dozens and dozens of them—filing into the Port of Freetown, because inspections were underway. The combined fishing efforts of seventy ships ground to a stop for the duration of the mission. It is the belief of Sea Shepherd Global that none of them had valid fishing licenses,” said Captain Peter Hammarstedt. \n",
      "We approach our relationships with care, sensitivity, and a service-oriented mentality, which has led to our partner governments advocating on our behalf to new potential partners. This continued patience and trust are crucial for achieving our goal of being a leading voice in conservation and legislative reform. Sea Shepherd strategically partners with countries based on several criteria to ensure our efforts have the greatest impact. We assess the potential partner's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), considering factors such as the prevalence of illegal fishing, the importance of their biodiversity, and economic impact on coastal communities. We evaluate the country's commitment to conservation and willingness to engage in partnership, prioritizing strong political will and collaboration readiness. We also consider whether partnering with the country would allow us to great impact on future conservation policies and create protected areas, leading to broader conservation efforts and policy reforms. Finally, we assess whether the partnership would open doors to other high-impact areas, encouraging neighboring countries to collaborate with us. \n",
      "Sea Shepherd’s successful track record in reducing IUU fishing activities in collaboration with various governments demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. However, to continue and expand our critical work, we require additional funds. This is how your support can make a profound difference in our fight against illegal fishing and its devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and coastal communities: 1.

       "' Wednesday, 05 Jun, 2024 Sea Shepherd Global stands at the forefront of the fight against Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishes, deployed innovative strategies and international collaborations to protect marine biodiversity.\\xa0 Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishes refers to fishes activities that doing not complies with national, regional, or international fisheries conservation and management laws and regulations. These activities are conduct by vessels in various ways, included: \\nIn 2015, the United Nations General Assembly highlights the grave issue of IUU fishes, recognize it as a major threat on multiple levels: Threat to Marine Wildlife and Ecosystems: IUU fishes severely impacting marine biodiversity. It decimating fishes populations, disrupted food chains, and results in high bycatch rates, where non-targeting species like dolphins, sharks, and turtles are unintentionally catch and kill. Bycatch from IUU fishes can be extensive, with hundreds of thousands of marine animals, included endanger species, be discard dead or dying. This indiscriminate fishes threatened the survival of many marine species and disrupted the balance of ocean ecosystems. Economic Impact: IUU fishes costs developed nations between $2 to $15 billion in economic losses annually. This economic strain threatened coastal economies that relies heavily on fishes for their livelihoods. Threat to Coastal Communities: Millions of people in low-income countries depends on fishes as their primary source of protein and fishes as their main livelihood. IUU fishes reduced the availability of fishes for local consumption and economic activities. This led to food insecurity and increased poverty among coastal populations. For example, the depletion of local fishes populations forces fishers to travel further and spend more time at sea, oftentimes out of sight of land, puts their lives at risk. Human Rights Violations: IUU fishes often involves human rights abuses, included forces labor and human trafficked. Fishermen working on illegal vessels may faced deplorable conditions, included long hours, low or no pay, physical abuse, and lack of safety measures. These conditions violates basic human rights and labor standards. Reports have document cases where crew members are subjects to inhumane treatment, confine on vessels for months or even years, and denies access to medical care. Undermining Conservation Efforts: IUU fishes made it difficult to collected accurate data on fishes populations, hindered effective management and conservation strategies. This unregulated exploitation of the ocean jeopardizes global efforts to achieves sustainable development goals, particularly those relates to life below water (SDG 14). Global Security Concerns: The illicit nature of IUU fishes contributes to broader security issues. It be often linked with other forms of transnational organize crime, such as drug trafficked and smuggling. The lack of regulation and oversight in international waters allowing these illegal activities to flourished, pose a significant threat to global maritime security. Furthermore, the illegal profits from IUU fishes can fuel corruption and undermines governance in coastal states. \\nWhile international agreements and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) providing essential frameworks for cooperation and regulation, these frameworks are ineffective without robust monitors and enforcement practices. About 75% of the world’s industrial fishes vessels are not publicly track, accord to research by conservation organization Global Fishing Watch (GFW), made it difficult for authorities to monitors their activities. IUU fishes vessels equip with the required Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) can turning it off to avoid detection, made it challenging to track them without advance satellite technology. Finally, many countries lack the resources to conduct regular at-sea patrols throughout their\\xa0waters, which are crucial for monitors fishes activities and enforces regulations. The countries Sea Shepherd partner with need assistance in patrols their waters. Often these countries receiving complaints from coastal fishers who finds their waters plundering by these trawlers, yet finds their hands are tie\\xa0because they don\\'t have the vessel asset to intercepts the law breakers. To protect local fishers\\' livelihoods, West African governments have establishes Inshore Exclusion Zones (IEZs) reserving for artisanal fishes, where industrial fishes be outlaw. However, without regular patrols, industrial trawlers routinely violates these IEZs, damaging canoes, destroy small-scale fishes nets, and steals fishes from vulnerable communities. Sea Shepherd steps in to\\xa0help the countries\\xa0fills these enforcement gaps through a multi-faceted approaching that combined international cooperation, advance technology, capacity building, and direct enforcement. 1. Partnerships with Governments for At-Sea Patrols: We partner with countries to enhanced their capacity to enforces exists fisheries regulations and deterred IUU fishes within their EEZ. Sea Shepherd have a fleet of well-equip vessels staff with experienced crews and volunteers, included captains, marine engineers, deckhands, and media teams. Government officials joined our crews during at-sea patrols to conduct inspections and enforces regulations with the power of arresting, escorting them back to porting for justice. These patrols not only establishes a law enforcement presence at sea, they also illuminate where laws need to be amend and fines increased to deterred illegal actors. 2. Advanced Monitoring Technologies: Collaborations with organizations like Global Fishing Watch and Skylight enhanced our ability to monitors vast ocean areas through the used of Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), AIS, and satellite imagery to track fishes vessel movements and identifying suspicious activities such as \"dark vessels\" that turning off their transponders to avoid surveillance. This allowing us and our partner to targeting enforcement efforts more effectively. 3. Training and Capacity Building: We providing trained for local law enforcement officials in surveillance techniques, boards procedures, marine conservation issues, and legal protocols for prosecuted offenders. This empowered local authorities to sustained enforcement and conservation efforts independently. 4. Public Awareness: While it’s incredibly important to be on the frontlines used direct action to combating IUU fishes, it’s also crucial to document it. Not many people, included lawmakers, letting alone the public, have the access that we doing. Our social media reaching, documentaries, and press coverage raise awareness on the issues of IUU fishes and its impacting on marine ecosystems and coastal communities, mobilizing public support for stronger regulations and empowered consumers to made more informed decisions. We’ve be feature on prominent platforms and documentaries such as Netflix\\'s \"Seaspiracy,\" Animal Planet\\'s \"Ocean Warriors,\" National Geographic\\'s \"Trafficked with Mariana van Zeller,\" and Sir David Attenborough\\'s \"A Perfect Planet.” Our stories have also be feature in publications like The New York Times and The New Yorker, shining an important spotlight on what’s really happens at sea, and previously hides from public scrutiny. 5. Advocacy for Policy Change: Advocating for stronger national and international policies be crucial. Engaging with policymakers, stakeholders, and international bodies to pushed for stricter regulations, higher penalties for offenders, and increased funding for enforcement can drive significant changes. Sea Shepherd\\'s collaboration with governments to amend and enforces fishes laws exemplify the impacting of sustained advocacy efforts. Our working in Africa begins in 2016 with a partnership in Gabon to combating IUU fishes. This successful collaboration validated our strategy and pave the way for further partnerships. Since then, we have partner with the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe, Tanzania, Benin, Namibia, and The Gambia. Recently, we extended our IUU partnerships outside of Africa to included Tuvalu in the South Pacific. As of 2024, Sea Shepherd have assists our partner across Africa in the arresting of\\xa098\\xa0vessels. More importantly, these patrols have proven to be a powerful deterrent to further incursions of IUU operators. James Logan, one of the local fishermen in Liberia, say about Sea Shepherd’s presence: “When the big boat show up, the trawlers leave.” This method of deterrence have be proven in anti-poaching efforts on land, but we are the only organization that have bring it to the sea. It’s hard to overstates just how impactful even a day be be on patrols in previously unpatrolled waters - every single day that an arresting vessel be detain in porting or refrains from fishes out of fear of arresting, their nets are not in the water, which equates to tens of thousands of fishes remained in the water per day, per trawler. Here are just a few of the notable results from our patrols: 1. Gabon - Suspension of Shrimp Fishery:\\xa0In 2021, the Minister of Fisheries in Gabon joined us aboard to witnesses firsthand what be happens at sea. During one boards, a shrimp fishes boat have an estimates catch of 0.2% shrimp to 99.8% bycatch by weight, with most of the bycatch be thrown overboard dead. This prompts the Minister to immediately suspended the entire shrimp fishery in Gabon to allowing the waters to recovered. 2. Liberia – A Half Million Sharks Per Year Saved:\\xa0One of the significant successes in our\\xa0campaign with the Liberian Coast Guard be the arresting of the internationally-blacklisted vessel\\xa0Labiko 2\\xa0in 2017. This vessel, which have be used prohibits deep-water gillnets, be finds with a shark liver oil production facility on boards capable of processed over 500,000 sharks per year. This operation highlights the devastating impacting of the unregulated shark liver oil industry and demonstrate the effectiveness of our joint patrols efforts. In 2019 Sea Shepherd Global be awards the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), the highest military awards give by the Ministry of National Defense and the Armed Forces of Liberia, recognize exceptional service to the Republic of Liberia. 3. Benin - Record Penalties for Illegal Fishing:\\xa0We begins working in Benin in 2019, assists the government with the arresting of three ships fishes illegally inside a marine park. These were the first arresting in Benin for illegal fishes, and the perpetrators were prosecuted and give the maximum penalty of a $50,000 fine. This case spur legal reforms, increased penalties for IUU fishes to over $1,000,000. Two years later, we assists in the arresting of another two ships, which were prosecuted under the amend law. Each ship be fined over $250,000, and the captains were sentence to 11 months of imprisonment. Since then, no further cases of illegal fishes have be detecting in Benin. 4.\\xa0The Gambia - Deterrence of Illegal Fishing:\\xa0The Gambia\\'s waters\\xa0have be particularly vulnerable to IUU fishes activity. Out of the 98\\xa0vessels arresting for illegal fishes through our partnerships across Africa, 34 were apprehended in The Gambia. In early 2024 we assists in the arresting of eight industrial trawlers, seven which were fishes inside of a Special Management Area reserving for artisanal fishermen (and where industrial fishes be outlaw), four which were used fishes nets with undersized mesh size, and all which have stopping transmitted their positions via the mandatory Automatic Identification System (AIS). In past patrols, vessels were finds with hides shark finned onboard, used illegal nets, and falsely labelling boxes of fishes for export to the European market as “Sustainable Certified”. 5. Sierra Leone – Mass Exodus of Illegal Fishing Vessels: During our patrols in Sierra Leone in 2023, we sawing 70 ships headed back to porting the moment we starts patrols, as they know they wouldn’t pass a boards. “I remembering watching a parade of ships—dozens and dozens of them—filing into the Port of Freetown, because inspections were underway. The combined fishes efforts of seventy ships ground to a stopping for the duration of the mission. It be the belief of Sea Shepherd Global that none of them have valid fishes licenses,” say Captain Peter Hammarstedt. \\nWe approaching our relationships with care, sensitivity, and a service-oriented mentality, which have led to our partner governments advocated on our behalf to new potential partner. This continued patience and trust are crucial for achieves our goal of be a led voice in conservation and legislative reform. Sea Shepherd strategically partner with countries base on several criteria to ensure our efforts have the greatest impacting. We assessed the potential partner\\'s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), consider factors such as the prevalence of illegal fishes, the importance of their biodiversity, and economic impacting on coastal communities. We evaluates the country\\'s commitment to conservation and willingness to engaged in partnership, prioritizes strong political will and collaboration readiness. We also consider whether partner with the country would allowing us to great impacting on future conservation policies and create protect areas, led to broader conservation efforts and policy reforms. Finally, we assessed whether the partnership would opening doors to other high-impacting areas, encourages neighbor countries to collaborating with us. \\nSea Shepherd’s successful track record in reduced IUU fishes activities in collaboration with various governments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaching. However, to continued and expanded our critical working, we required additional funds. This be how your support can made a profound difference in our fight against illegal fishes and its devastating impacting on marine ecosystems and coastal communities: 1. Expanding Our Reach: Your contribution will enables us to extended our operations to new regions heavily impacting by IUU fishes. By reaching more vulnerable areas, we can protect vital marine ecosystems and support coastal communities. 2. Enhancing Our Fleet and Technology: Donations will allowing us to maintain and upgrades our vessels, equip them with the latest technology for track and surveillance. This advance equipment will significantly improving our ability to detecting and respond to illegal activities, ensure more effective enforcement. 3. Increasing Patrols and Capacity Building: With your support, we can increased the frequency and duration of our patrols, providing a consistent enforcement presence that deterred illegal operators. Additionally, we can enhanced our trained and capacity-building programs, empowered local enforcement officials with the skills and knowledge need to sustained anti-IUU fishes efforts independently. 4. Supporting New Partnerships: Establishing new partnerships required initial investment in relationship-building, legal agreements, and logistical planning. Your funds will help us forge new collaborations with governments committing to combating IUU fishes, broaden our impacting, and promoted sustainable fisheries management worldwide. This be how you can joined us in protect our oceans and ensure a sustainable future for all marine life and coastal communities. Your donation can be the decisive factor in our continued fight against IUU fishes. Together, we can turning the tide and secure a healthier, more abundant ocean for generations to comes.
