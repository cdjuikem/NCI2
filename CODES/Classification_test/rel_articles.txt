B.C.’s Supreme Court has upheld almost $96,000 in fishery fines against two men and a company for fishing offences around Haida Gwaii in 2018 and 2019.

The appellants claimed regulations made under the federal Fisheries Act were unlawful and that their sentences should be varied, claiming there had been additional fines.

The Feb. 2 decision from Justice Miriam Maisonville regarded two appeals of fines laid in provincial court in two 2022 provincial court cases.

The first provincial court ruling
In one decision, Judge David Patterson found that Adam Munro, Silas Levesque and ATM Fishing Ltd. exceeded their chinook salmon quota as set out in the federal Fisheries Act. Patterson said those offences occurred between July 22 and Aug. 9, 2018, near Masset on Haida Gwaii.

Patterson found that Munro, Levesque, and ATM possessed fish caught in contravention of the act or its regulations. Those offences happened between July 22 and Aug. 15, 2018, near Masset or elsewhere in B.C.

The judge ruled that Levesque, as master of the Wind Walker I, failed to comply with a licence condition. That condition required him to submit data forms known as fish slips no later than seven days after landing. Those events took place between July 28, 2018 and Nov. 5, 2019, near Masset, Patterson said in his Jan. 6 decision.

The judge said throughout 2018, Munro was the owner of the Wind Walker I, a vessel licensed to participate in B.C.’s Salmon Area F Salmon Troll Fishery.  Levesque was the skipper. The vessel's licence conditions allowed for the catch and retention of 390 chinook salmon in 2018.

According to the ruling, on July 22, 2018, 357 chinook salmon were offloaded from the Wind Walker I in Prince Rupert. Then, on Aug 8, 2018, 327 chinook were offloaded. That's 294 more fish than allowed.

The second provincial court ruling
In the second case, Patterson found that the Crown had proven four charges under the act against Munro and 605463 B.C. Ltd.

Michael Andrew Bullock is the sole director and officer of 605463 B.C. Ltd., Patterson said. Munro was the skipper or vessel master of the Winter Wind.

The charges were: exceeding the maximum quota, between July 22, 2018 and Aug. 11, 2018, near Masset; failing to ensure that catch service logs were delivered between April 30, 2019 and July 17, 2019; selling fish caught in contravention of the act; and possessing fish caught in contravention of the act.

On July 22, 2018, Munro and 605463 B.C. Ltd. offloaded 346 chinook salmon caught on the Winter Wind. They were left with a remaining quota of 44, unless another licence holder transferred a share of their total allowable catch to the Winter Wind.

It had been anticipated that a quota transfer to the Winter Wind was going to occur.

However, that didn’t happen and, on Aug. 11, 2018, the vessel was 217 chinook salmon over its limit.

“Therefore, 217 were illegally fished for, possessed and sold,” Patterson said.

Appeals dismissed
Justice Maisonville dismissed both grounds of appeal.

She said the application of the regulations and any delegation of them was not unlawful.

On the imposition of additional fines, Maisonville said the law allows a sentencing judge discretion in levying additional fines.

“It was found that financial benefits flowed to the appellants as a matter of their negligence and lack of due diligence, and I would not disturb this result,” Maisonville ruled.

A commercial fisherman in Alaska will pay a fine of USD 1 million (EUR 850,000) and spend up to a six months in prison for misreporting his catch.

Kodiak fisherman James Aaron Stevens was sentenced last week for “knowingly submitting false records concerning the locations and regulatory areas where fish were harvested,” according to the U.S. District Attorney’s Office, Alaska District.

The attorney’s office announced last August that Stevens had plead guilty to one count of false labeling, which constituted a Lacey Act violation. The false reporting occurred during 26 fishing trips between 2014 and 2017, when Stevens served as the owner and operator of the F/V Southern Seas and the F/V Alaskan Star.

“Specifically, Stevens knowingly falsified International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) logbooks, daily fishing logbooks, Alaska Department of Fish and Game fish tickets, and landing reports to show that fishing gear had been deployed in areas where the vessels did not fish, and omitted areas in which the fish were actually harvested,” the district attorney’s office said. “In addition to his falsified logbooks, the investigation further revealed that Stevens maintained the accurate fishing information in a separate, personal log.”

Stevens falsely reported the harvest of some 903,208 pounds of halibut and sablefish, which added up to around USD 4.5 million (EUR 3.83 million) in ex-vessel value and USD 13.5 million (EUR 11.5 million) in market value.


"Stevens sold the falsely labeled fish caught during these trips, which were, or were intended to be, transported in interstate and foreign commerce,” the district attorney’s office said.

Kodiak radio station KMXT reported that Stevens’ legal team had requested intermittent home confinement so Stevens could continue fishing, but the request was denied.

“Many family members, friends, and fellow fishermen wrote letters in support of Stevens, pointing to his role as a father and husband with a strong and honest work ethic. Some letters asked for the fine to be reduced. A letter written by Janiese Stevens, James’s wife, pointed to instability and inequities in the halibut and sablefish IFQ program that put economic strains on fishermen,” KMXT reported.

An investigation by NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement led to the charges against Stevens, who will also serve community service and make a public announcement regarding the false reporting.

SEOUL, Jan. 11 (Yonhap) -- A Chinese fishing boat has been seized for allegedly underreporting its fish catch in violation of Seoul's fishing regulations, the oceans ministry said Tuesday.

The ministry's fisheries management service seized the 106-ton vessel in waters off the southwestern county of Shinan at around 6 p.m. on Monday, as its crew members were suspected of having underreported the fish catch on a daily log to catch more from South Korea's exclusive economic zone in the Yellow Sea, according to the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.

An additional probe is now under way, and any violations will lead to fines or other penalties, it added.

"There have been increasing cases of Chinese fishing boats trying to evade our on-board investigations, citing the COVID-19 pandemic," ministry official Yang Jin-moon said.

"We will toughen the crackdown and seizure operations while implementing thorough antivirus measures," it added.

Environmental law group ClientEarth and the Low Impact Fishers of Europe (LIFE) have joined forces to file legal action against the Dutch food and consumer product safety authority (NVWA) over claims it has failed to police misreporting of fish catches and overfishing, in direct violation of the laws of the European Union.

The move comes one year after the organizations launched a legal challenge against the government of The Netherlands for routinely failing to check how much fish is being brought ashore from refrigerated cargo ships, more commonly known as reefers, and instead relying on estimated data declared by fishers in their logbooks.

A formal request was sent to NVWA in June 2022, demanding that the agency improve its monitoring system, as required by E.U. fisheries law, to safeguard fish stocks and the livelihoods of small-scale, low-impact fishers.

The challenge was prompted by an investigation by Dutch newspaper Groene Amsterdammer, which highlighted issues with the Dutch fisheries control system. Its investigation revealed a severe lack of inspectors to adequately monitor the 400 million kilograms of frozen herring, mackerel, and blue whiting landed into the Netherlands each year, and the delegation to a private company with no power of authority to check landed boxes of frozen fish on behalf of the port authorities.

Under the rules of the E.U.’s common fisheries policy (CFP), fishing companies must weigh frozen pelagic fish products before landing. The NVWA is tasked with properly checking and weighing a legally prescribed sample at the port to verify against declared weights, and claims to inspect at least 10 percent of the country’s catch.

In 2020, the European Commission finalized an investigation into the issue that concluded that millions of kilograms of illegal fish may have passed through Dutch ports in recent years, and informed the country’s government it was out of compliance with European rules for fisheries controls. After what it described as an inadequate response from the Dutch government, the E.C. set its infringement procedure in motion in February 2022, calling on the Netherlands to ensure compliance with rules on weighing, traceability, and catch registration. If the reply is not satisfactory, the E.C. may decide to refer the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union.


Simultaneously, LIFE and ClientEarth requested the NVWA swiftly improve its inspection process in 2021, but their request was rejected. In a press release, the organizations said that rejection prompted the organizations to take another action on 29 June, asking for concrete proof that fraud is not happening. If convincing evidence to the contrary is not provided in the near future, they believe they will “be left with no choice but to go to court.”

“As the gateway for a large part of E.U. fish onto the market, the Netherlands has a crucial guardian role to play in preventing overfishing,” ClientEarth fisheries lawyer Nils Courcy said. “It is abnormal and alarming that Dutch authorities have rejected a request to properly check what’s being taken from the sea and enforce proper scrutiny of their vessels and ports. Their refusal to step up to the plate sends utterly the wrong signal – it seems they are saying that illegal fishing and overfishing can happen under their watch. We’re now stepping up action and asking the Dutch authorities again to provide concrete proof that fraud is not happening. If we don’t see convincing evidence to the contrary, we’ll be left with no choice but to go to court.”

In particular, the logbook records of the super-trawler Margiris, owned by Dutch company Parlevliet and Van der Plas, have been requested. The activities of this vessel, which is the second largest trawler in the world, can process 250 metric tons (MT) of fish per day and carry 6,000 MT, are already under investigation. This follows the mass spillage of more than 100,000 blue whiting in the Bay of Biscay earlier this year after the trawler’s net ruptured.

LIFE Executive Secretary Brian O’Riordan said The Netherlands’ factory vessels are “potentially underreporting thousands of tons of fish each trip.”

“If that’s true, this is depleting the ocean of its planet-stabilising ecosystems and unfairly depriving low-impact fishers and coastal communities from their source of livelihood,” he said. “It is also undermining the whole E.U. marine management system and the scientific assessments that form the basis of E.U. fishing quotas.”

Five Maine fishermen and one fisherman from New Hampshire took plea deals Monday, ending the trial for the multi-year scheme of selling unreported herring and forging fishing records.

The fishermen included Glenn Robbins of Eliot, Maine; Neil Herrick of Rockland, Maine; Stephen Little of Warren, Maine; Ethan Chase of Portsmouth, N.H.; and Jason Parent of Owls Head, Maine, were indicted in January 2022 on 35 counts of conspiracy, fraud, and falsifying fishing records. Western Seas Inc. owned the fishing vessel Western Sea, which was used to catch the fish.

Robbins owns the Western Seas and pleads guilty to conspiracy to submit false information to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce about his Atlantic herring catch and sale. According to Bangor Daily News, the defendants could receive sentences of up to a year in prison, fines of up to $100,000, and one year of supervised release.

The vessel engaged in more than 80 fishing trips for herring between June 2016 and September 2019, with a catch that was unreported to NOAA Fisheries. The indictment alleged that the crew had sold more than 2.6 million pounds of herring to five separate fish dealers and three lobster captains. Three of the dealers paid more than $460,000 for the unreported fish.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office paperwork states that the Western Sea underreported the fish caught while the boat was fishing. The crew then sold to fish buyers who underreported how much they had received. The crew was then paid in cash for fish caught above what was legally caught.

NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement and the Maine Marine Patrol investigated this case.

A boat captain from Sambro, N.S., with a history of fishery convictions has been fined $60,000 and banned from fishing for six months for five violations that included a secret, middle-of-the-night offload of halibut.

The case involved misreporting of halibut, hake and cod catch from trips on board the fishing boat Ivy Lew between May 2019 and June 2020.

Casey Henneberry, 40, and ALS Fisheries and Law Fisheries were found guilty last October by Halifax provincial court Judge Elizabeth Buckle.

The sentence was handed down in court last month and posted this week.

"Mr. Henneberry's offending conduct is that he inaccurately logged and hailed weight of groundfish on four trips over approximately one year and on one of those trips, he illegally off-loaded $40,000 worth of halibut, intending to sell it," Buckle said in her written sentence.

On that trip, DFO officers were observing the Ivy Lew and intercepted the illegal off-load in Sambro. During the attempted arrests of those involved, Henneberry fled and was arrested later, the judge noted in sentencing.

During this period the groundfish licence was held first by Law Fisheries and then ALS Fisheries. The companies were fined $55,000 and $10,000 respectively for failing to ensure licence conditions were complied with.

ALS Fisheries owns the Ivy Lew, which has been held for the past three years by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, likely as security on any fine.

The company has continued to pay on the $1-million mortgage on the vessel.

The Captain's story

Henneberry is a lifelong fisherman with hundreds of trips as a captain.

He does not own any fishing business, but earns $150,000 a year as a captain — money used to pay child support and for therapy and assistance for a child with developmental challenges.

Henneberry has three prior convictions for failing to observe licence conditions, including failing to hail out (or provide notification a trip is underway), possession of undersized halibut and several other instances of misreporting.

The crown wanted a fine of $140,000 and a two-year licence suspension for Henneberry.

Buckle said the fact that he is financially responsible for his family and fully engaged in his child's life is a mitigating factor.

He has five years to pay the fine.

The Sambro family connection

In her decision, Buckle said in 2019, ALS had four directors who were all related to Henneberry.

Each of its four directors have prior convictions for Fisheries Act offences. Two are also directors of Law Fisheries.

The Crown did not allege prior record for either company.

Buckle said both companies' "annual quota for groundfish is a significant share of the fleet allowance and has substantial value."

The Crown argued their corporate conduct appeared intentional and at the very least amounted to gross negligence.

It sought a fine of $30,000 for ALS and $180,000 for Law.

Buckle acknowledged the lack of diligence by the companies, which failed "to do anything to oversee their licences in circumstances where they should have been extra vigilant.

"However, I am not persuaded that they were involved in a deliberate effort to thwart the regulations, that they had intent or knowledge of the offences or were purposefully indifferent to their obligations."

She also addressed the crown submission that all the ALS directors were previously the directors of a defunct company that was convicted of fisheries offences in 2006, sentenced to pay fines of over $600,000 but discontinued operations and never paid its fines.

"I accept the Crown's submission that this is relevant to the need for specific deterrence and speaks to the effectiveness of corporate fines alone as deterrents. However, the fact that DFO holds the Ivy Lew as security makes it likely that any fine against ALS will be paid."

Georgetown court dealt with several cases Thursday involving the underreporting of catches in P.E.I.'s snow crab fishery.

Four fishermen who pleaded guilty to violating section 43.4(1) of the federal Fisheries Act were fined: Jason Ahearn, James Gavin, Earl MacRae and Jeffery MacLeod. Charges were dropped against Casey Gavin.

Others among the 13 people originally charged were fined earlier.

In most cases, the fines amounted to $1,500 per offence.

Judge Nancy Orr expressed frustration at the low fines set out in the sentencing guidelines for this type of charge, saying the fines aren't much of a disincentive if someone ends up being able to sell 20,000 pounds of snow crab that didn't get reported as counting toward their quota. She made the remarks in relation to the sentencing of James Gavin. Court heard Gavin had an extensive record, with convictions dating back to 1995. Gavin was fined $2,500.

Operation Gannet

The cases in Georgetown court Thursday followed a Department of Fisheries and Oceans investigation in Souris dating back to 2019 and 2020. It was called Operation Gannet.

Both fishers and dockside monitors ended up being charged.

Court was told that fisheries officers watched as snow crab catches were landed and the monitors recorded the amounts.

Circumstances were similar in all their cases: estimates by fishers, and records from monitors, showed catches were much lower than the landings observed by fishery officers — in some cases, by 20,000 pounds.

A trial also began Thursday for fisherman Leo Dorgan, who has pleaded not guilty to failing to report his catches accurately. His is the final case connected to Operation Gannet.

One dockside monitor who earlier pleaded guilty to 24 counts was involved in some of Dorgan's landings, court heard.

The two-day trial is expected to wrap up Friday.

'A conservation matter'

Carter Hutt, chair of the P.E.I. Snow Crab Association, declined CBC's request for an interview on the charges.

"It's a conservation matter," Orr said during a May court hearing connected to Operation Gannet.

"Everybody is aware snow crab is a lucrative fishery in this jurisdiction … Captains get the big bucks, they also get the big responsibility."

Defence lawyer Clifford Hood argued at the same hearing that his clients failed to fill out the proper paperwork, but did not exceed their overall share of snow crab quota.

Hood said it's not unusual for crab crews to shift quota from boat to boat.

Five fishermen who were charged with being part of a multi-year scheme of falsifying herring catch and selling unreported herring pleaded guilty soon after a federal trial began. 

The federal trial began on 7 March and was expected to last for nine days, with Glenn Robbins of Eliot, Maine; Neil Herrick of Rockland, Maine; Stephen Little of Warren, Maine; Ethan Chase of Portsmouth, New Hampshire; Jason Parent of Owls Head, Maine; and Western Sea Inc. all charged with conspiracy, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice as part of their efforts to falsify their herring catch, the Penobscot Bay Pilot reported. Robbins, in particular, owned the F/V Western Sea – a Maine herring seiner.

According to the Courier-Gazette, from June 2016 through September 2019, the Western Sea and its crew underreported the number of herring caught and sold fish to buyers who also underreported how much fish they had received. The fishermen were then paid cash for the extra fish that they caught. Herring regulations in the state of Maine require herring fishers submit an electronic report of total catch before landing. 

Now, the Portland Press Herald reported that the five fishermen have all pleaded guilty to lesser offenses in a plea deal with federal prosecutors. With the deal, 59 counts against the fishermen were dismissed for lesser charges.


Robbins pleaded guilty to submitting false information to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce – which overseas NOAA Fisheries – on the catch and sale of herring, as well as falsifying information to the secretary of the treasury. 

Chase, Herrick, Little, and Parent also pleaded guilty to submitting false information and failing to pay income taxes.

“This type of unscrupulous and unlawful fishing alleged in the indictment returned by the grand jury directly affects the economic benefit of law-abiding fishermen and fishing communities,” NOAA Office of Law Enforcement Director James Landon said in a release. “We will continue to help bring to justice those who are proven to have violated U.S. fishing laws and regulations to help ensure the sustainability of our living marine resources while also maximizing economic benefit.”

According to the Press Herald, the plea agreements carry a maximum sentence of a year in prison, a fine of up to USD 100,000 (EUR 91,800), and up to one year of supervised release – with the possibility that none of the defendants see jail time.

On August 6, the Spanish long-line fishing vessel Alemar Primero was boarded in waters belonging to the Central African island state of São Tomé, and authorities found the vessel’s holds filled with dead sharks.

The Príncipe by São Toméan authorities, assisted by Sea Shepherd crew and law enforcement officers from Gabon, confirmed that most of the sharks were blue sharks, classified as “near-threatened” by the IUCN. 

The long liner was licensed to fish for “tuna and similar species.” 

Many of the shark’s fins had already been detached from their bodies, a suspected violation, says Sea Shepherd, of the European Union Finning Ban (1185/2003) and its amendment (605/2013), which requires sharks to be landed with their Fins Naturally Attached (FNA).

São Toméan authorities ordered the long-liner to retrieve their fishing gear, release their catch and proceed to São Tomé for investigation. With four marines remaining on board for security, the long-liner was escorted to São Tomé by the Sea Shepherd vessel Bob Barker.

On August 7, the Alemar Primero arrived in the fishing village of Neves where it will remain, pending investigations.

Since April 2016, under the name Operation Albacore, Sea Shepherd has been assisting the Government of Gabon to tackle illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by providing the use of the Bob Barker as a civilian offshore patrol vessel operating in Gabonese waters, under the direction of the Gabonese Government.

In August, São Tomé and Príncipe sent two marines and one fisheries observer from São Tomé to join Sea Shepherd crew, Gabonese marines and Gabonese fisheries enforcement officers on board the Bob Barker, to further detect and deter illegal fishing in the Gulf of Guinea.

On the 5th of September, the Spanish long-line fishing vessel Baz was boarded in waters belonging to the Central African island state of São Tomé and Príncipe by São Toméan authorities, assisted by marine conservationists from Sea Shepherd and law enforcement officers from Gabon during a joint operation called Operation Albacore.

Although the long-liner was licensed to fish for 'tuna and similar species' inspections revealed that their fish holds were mostly filled with sharks, predominately blue sharks that are classified as 'near-threatened' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but also shortfin mako sharks classified as ‘vulnerable’, one category away from ‘endangered’. Many of the shark fins had already been detached from their bodies, a suspected violation of the European Union Finning Ban (1185/2003) and its amendment (605/2013), which requires any captured sharks to be delivered with their Fins Naturally Attached (FNA).

There were almost twice as many sharks as tuna on board the Baz, with the vessel carrying 62,730 kilograms of blue sharks and 6,242 kilograms of shortfin mako shark, compared to 36,943 kilograms of Bigeye Tuna and 5,387 kilograms of Yellowfin Tuna.

Fishing line tracers (or snoods), which are the monofilament segments that support the fishing hooks, were reinforced with steel wire, thereby underlining the suspicion that the targeted species of the Baz was mainly sharks, not tuna. Steel snoods are used so that sharks do not bite through the fishing line and escape.

Fish on board were also found gutted and processed, which is a violation of São Toméan fisheries regulations when advance approval has not been sought, which the Baz did not obtain.

Just over one year earlier, on August 2016, São Toméan authorities, again operating on board Sea Shepherd’s M/Y Bob Barker, arrested a Spanish long-line fishing vessel, the Alemar Primero. On board the Alemar Primero were 87 tons of sharks and shark fins. The vessel was subsequently arrested and released three weeks later after paying a fine for various offenses unrelated to shark finning because, although covered under the European Union Finning Ban, shark finning is not yet expressly banned under São Toméan national legislation.

“The São Toméan fisheries department lodged a complaint with the EU Directorate-General of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG Mare) to follow up on the European Union Finning Ban charges, but oddly charges were not pursued in Spain, the vessel Flag State, under the excuse of double jeopardy, claiming that penalties had already been meted out in São Tomé despite the fact that those penalties were not for shark finning”, said Sea Shepherd Director of Campaigns Peter Hammarstedt.

On the 10thof October 2017, the São Toméan fisheries department issued a Notice of Violation of Fisheries Rules to the Spanish ship owner as well as a request to the European Commission to investigate the violation of the European Union Finning Ban.

Sea Shepherd believes that the inspection and boarding of the Baz is an opportunity for the Spanish Flag State to finally reign in the criminal activities of its long-line fleet.

“The evasion of European responsibility in pursing charges against the Alemar Primero for violating the EU Finning Ban is why the Spanish long-line fishing fleet feels confident to continue finning sharks in São Toméan waters in violation of European conservation regulations,” said Peter Hammarstedt. “The EU DG Mare must set an example with the Baz. If the Spanish Flag State does not penalize the Baz, then there will be no justice for São Tomé and Príncipe and the EU Finning Ban will be toothless.”

About Operation Albacore

In 2016 Sea Shepherd partnered with the government of Gabon for the first Operation Albacore campaign, resulting in over 40 fishing vessel inspections at sea and the subsequent arrest of three IUU Congolese fishing trawlers and one Spanish long-liner. Operation Albacore re-commenced in 2017 with the arrival of the Bob Barker in Gabon on the 5th of July.

In September, São Tomé and Príncipe continued its partnership with Operation Albacore, sending two marines and one fisheries observer from São Tomé to join Sea Shepherd crew, Gabonese marines (Marine Nationale) and Gabonese fisheries enforcement (ANPA) officers on board the M/Y Bob Barker, to further detect and deter IUU fishing in the Gulf of Guinea.

The campaign aims to expand existing monitoring, control and surveillance measures; to detect and deter IUU fishing activity while also monitoring legal compliance by licensed fishing operators. Throughout the 2017 tuna fishing season, Marine Nationale and ANPA have been stationed on board the Bob Barker, working alongside Sea Shepherd crew to patrol Gabon's sovereign waters.

The European Union Finning Ban was passed as a conservation measure to ensure that shark bodies are not discarded at sea in order to make room for the more valuable shark fins, resulting in far more sharks killed than would otherwise be the case. Sharks are being killed in increasingly large numbers to meet an Asian demand for fins to make shark fin soup.  One-third of shark species are overfished to the extent that they risk extinction.

A notorious Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish poaching vessel, famous for plundering the Antarctic, was arrested on March 13th in waters belonging to the West African state of Liberia by the Liberian Coast Guard, with assistance from Sea Shepherd.

The F/V Hai Lung, known to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) by its previous name ‘Kily’, was transiting through Liberian waters when it was boarded and inspected by a Liberian Coast Guard team working alongside Sea Shepherd crew on board Sea Shepherd’s patrol vessel M/Y Sam Simon.

Operating under a long list of different names; including ‘Yele’, ‘Ray’, ‘Kily’, ‘Constant’, ‘Tropic’ and ‘Isla Graciosa’; the F/V Hai Lung is an infamous fishing vessel that has been blacked-listed by several regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) including CCAMLR, SEAFO and NEAFC.

As a result, the vessel has been denied port access in Togo and Angola, and unofficial sources state that it was detained in Nigeria for entering Nigerian waters without authorization last year.

Once on board the F/V Hai Lung, the Liberian Coast Guard Boarding Officer was presented with forged documentation alleging that the F/V Hai Lung was flagged to the Republic of Indonesia as a fishing vessel.

The Certificate of Nationality was allegedly issued on the 8th of August 2017 in Jakarta, Indonesia by a senior Ministry of Transportation official who had long since been transferred to another government position. The Indonesian Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries has no record of the vessel in their databases.

The forged Certificate of Nationality makes the F/V Hai Lung a vessel ‘without nationality’, subject to seizure anywhere, including on the High Seas.

Fines totalling $120,500 were imposed on the captain of Korean fishing vessel Oyang 77 for dumping quota fish at sea and misreporting the catch.

With the conviction and sentencing of the captain, Dae Jun Lee, 30, the trawler and its fishing gear is now automatically forfeited to the Crown.

However, the prosecutor for the Ministry of Primary Industries, Chris Lange, said it was expected that the owners would file an application for relief from forfeiture, which would trigger a separate hearing.

The ship is owned by the Sajo Oyang Corporation, while Southern Storm Fishing 2007 Ltd was the fishing quota permit holder and chartered the vessel.

The trawler is a sister ship to the Oyang 70, which sank off Otago in August 2010 killing six, and of the Oyang 75, whose crew walked off in protest at claimed inhumane conditions aboard.

The Oyang 77 did 11 trawling trips in the New Zealand region, and was tied up at Lyttelton during the 14-day hearing last year. Christchurch District Court Judge Brian Callaghan was able to visit it during the hearing.

Lee pleaded guilty during the trial to charges of omitting to report that a basking shark had been caught in the net and returned to the sea, and omitting to include details in the catch documentation about fish catch lost at sea when a net broke and sank. He was found guilty of the fish dumping and misreporting charges at the end of the trial.

Lange said there was an inherent difficulty in prosecuting this type of case and presenting accurate evidence at the hearing.

"The fisheries regime relies on the honesty of those who exercise the privilege of fishing to ensure the sustainability of the fishery for current and a future generations."

Lee had been aware of his obligations not to dump fish at sea, and had told crew not to do any dumping when a fisheries observer was on board.

Squid, hoki, barracouta were involved in the discarding and false catch returns. The total amount of catch involved was 75.8 tonnes.

Lange said 53 tonnes of hoki had been dumped because it was uneconomic to process because the fish was small or damaged, and then higher quality fish worth $73,000 had been caught and processed.

Defence counsel Mark Dollimore contrasted the Crown call for a $200,000 fine with comparable cases. There was no suggestion that the discarding resulted in anything more than an increase in pay through an incentive scheme for Lee.

He suggested fines totalling no more than $80,000.

Judge Callaghan said the offending was clandestine and difficult to discover and prosecute. "The protection of the resource and its proper management is a major factor as well."

Lee was not at court for the sentencing. The Oyang 77 is at present fishing off Uruguay, South America. The Crown holds a bond in such cases.
