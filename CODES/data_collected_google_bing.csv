Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,Sea Shepherd Global," Wednesday, 05 Jun, 2024 Sea Shepherd Global stands at the forefront of the fight against Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, deploying innovative strategies and international collaborations to protect marine biodiversity.  Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing refers to fishing activities that do not comply with national, regional, or international fisheries conservation and management laws and regulations. These activities are conducted by vessels in various ways, including: 
In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly highlighted the grave issue of IUU fishing, recognizing it as a major threat on multiple levels: Threat to Marine Wildlife and Ecosystems: IUU fishing severely impacts marine biodiversity. It decimates fish populations, disrupts food chains, and results in high bycatch rates, where non-target species like dolphins, sharks, and turtles are unintentionally caught and killed. Bycatch from IUU fishing can be extensive, with hundreds of thousands of marine animals, including endangered species, being discarded dead or dying. This indiscriminate fishing threatens the survival of many marine species and disrupts the balance of ocean ecosystems. Economic Impact: IUU fishing costs developing nations between $2 to $15 billion in economic losses annually. This economic strain threatens coastal economies that rely heavily on fishing for their livelihoods. Threat to Coastal Communities: Millions of people in low-income countries depend on fish as their primary source of protein and fishing as their main livelihood. IUU fishing reduces the availability of fish for local consumption and economic activities. This leads to food insecurity and increased poverty among coastal populations. For example, the depletion of local fish populations forces fishers to travel further and spend more time at sea, oftentimes out of sight of land, putting their lives at risk. Human Rights Violations: IUU fishing often involves human rights abuses, including forced labor and human trafficking. Fishermen working on illegal vessels may face deplorable conditions, including long hours, low or no pay, physical abuse, and lack of safety measures. These conditions violate basic human rights and labor standards. Reports have documented cases where crew members are subjected to inhumane treatment, confined on vessels for months or even years, and denied access to medical care. Undermining Conservation Efforts: IUU fishing makes it difficult to collect accurate data on fish populations, hindering effective management and conservation strategies. This unregulated exploitation of the ocean jeopardizes global efforts to achieve sustainable development goals, particularly those related to life below water (SDG 14). Global Security Concerns: The illicit nature of IUU fishing contributes to broader security issues. It is often linked with other forms of transnational organized crime, such as drug trafficking and smuggling. The lack of regulation and oversight in international waters allows these illegal activities to flourish, posing a significant threat to global maritime security. Furthermore, the illegal profits from IUU fishing can fuel corruption and undermine governance in coastal states. 
While international agreements and Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) provide essential frameworks for cooperation and regulation, these frameworks are ineffective without robust monitoring and enforcement practices. About 75% of the world’s industrial fishing vessels are not publicly tracked, according to research by conservation organization Global Fishing Watch (GFW), making it difficult for authorities to monitor their activities. IUU fishing vessels equipped with the required Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) can turn it off to avoid detection, making it challenging to track them without advanced satellite technology. Finally, many countries lack the resources to conduct regular at-sea patrols throughout their waters, which are crucial for monitoring fishing activities and enforcing regulations. The countries Sea Shepherd partners with need assistance in patrolling their waters. Often these countries receive complaints from coastal fishers who find their waters plundered by these trawlers, yet find their hands are tied because they don't have the vessel asset to intercept the law breakers. To protect local fishers' livelihoods, West African governments have established Inshore Exclusion Zones (IEZs) reserved for artisanal fishing, where industrial fishing is outlawed. However, without regular patrols, industrial trawlers routinely violate these IEZs, damaging canoes, destroying small-scale fishing nets, and stealing fish from vulnerable communities. Sea Shepherd steps in to help the countries fill these enforcement gaps through a multi-faceted approach that combines international cooperation, advanced technology, capacity building, and direct enforcement. 1. Partnerships with Governments for At-Sea Patrols: We partner with countries to enhance their capacity to enforce existing fisheries regulations and deter IUU fishing within their EEZ. Sea Shepherd has a fleet of well-equipped vessels staffed with experienced crews and volunteers, including captains, marine engineers, deckhands, and media teams. Government officials join our crews during at-sea patrols to conduct inspections and enforce regulations with the power of arrest, escorting them back to port for justice. These patrols not only establish a law enforcement presence at sea, they also illuminate where laws need to be amended and fines increased to deter illegal actors. 2. Advanced Monitoring Technologies: Collaborations with organizations like Global Fishing Watch and Skylight enhance our ability to monitor vast ocean areas through the use of Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS), AIS, and satellite imagery to track fishing vessel movements and identify suspicious activities such as ""dark vessels"" that turn off their transponders to avoid surveillance. This allows us and our partners to target enforcement efforts more effectively. 3. Training and Capacity Building: We provide training for local law enforcement officials in surveillance techniques, boarding procedures, marine conservation issues, and legal protocols for prosecuting offenders. This empowers local authorities to sustain enforcement and conservation efforts independently. 4. Public Awareness: While it’s incredibly important to be on the frontlines using direct action to combat IUU fishing, it’s also crucial to document it. Not many people, including lawmakers, let alone the public, have the access that we do. Our social media reach, documentaries, and press coverage raise awareness on the issues of IUU fishing and its impacts on marine ecosystems and coastal communities, mobilizing public support for stronger regulations and empowering consumers to make more informed decisions. We’ve been featured on prominent platforms and documentaries such as Netflix's ""Seaspiracy,"" Animal Planet's ""Ocean Warriors,"" National Geographic's ""Trafficked with Mariana van Zeller,"" and Sir David Attenborough's ""A Perfect Planet.” Our stories have also been featured in publications like The New York Times and The New Yorker, shining an important spotlight on what’s really happening at sea, and previously hidden from public scrutiny. 5. Advocacy for Policy Change: Advocating for stronger national and international policies is crucial. Engaging with policymakers, stakeholders, and international bodies to push for stricter regulations, higher penalties for offenders, and increased funding for enforcement can drive significant changes. Sea Shepherd's collaboration with governments to amend and enforce fishing laws exemplifies the impact of sustained advocacy efforts. Our work in Africa began in 2016 with a partnership in Gabon to combat IUU fishing. This successful collaboration validated our strategy and paved the way for further partnerships. Since then, we have partnered with the governments of Liberia, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe, Tanzania, Benin, Namibia, and The Gambia. Recently, we extended our IUU partnerships outside of Africa to include Tuvalu in the South Pacific. As of 2024, Sea Shepherd has assisted our partners across Africa in the arrest of 98 vessels. More importantly, these patrols have proven to be a powerful deterrent to further incursions of IUU operators. James Logan, one of the local fishermen in Liberia, said about Sea Shepherd’s presence: “When the big boat shows up, the trawlers leave.” This method of deterrence has been proven in anti-poaching efforts on land, but we are the only organization that has brought it to the sea. It’s hard to overstate just how impactful even a day is being on patrol in previously unpatrolled waters - every single day that an arrested vessel is detained in port or refrains from fishing out of fear of arrest, their nets are not in the water, which equates to tens of thousands of fish remaining in the water per day, per trawler. Here are just a few of the notable results from our patrols: 1. Gabon - Suspension of Shrimp Fishery: In 2021, the Minister of Fisheries in Gabon joined us aboard to witness firsthand what was happening at sea. During one boarding, a shrimp fishing boat had an estimated catch of 0.2% shrimp to 99.8% bycatch by weight, with most of the bycatch being thrown overboard dead. This prompted the Minister to immediately suspend the entire shrimp fishery in Gabon to allow the waters to recover. 2. Liberia – A Half Million Sharks Per Year Saved: One of the significant successes in our campaign with the Liberian Coast Guard was the arrest of the internationally-blacklisted vessel Labiko 2 in 2017. This vessel, which had been using prohibited deep-water gillnets, was found with a shark liver oil production facility on board capable of processing over 500,000 sharks per year. This operation highlighted the devastating impact of the unregulated shark liver oil industry and demonstrated the effectiveness of our joint patrol efforts. In 2019 Sea Shepherd Global was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), the highest military award given by the Ministry of National Defense and the Armed Forces of Liberia, recognizing exceptional service to the Republic of Liberia. 3. Benin - Record Penalties for Illegal Fishing: We began working in Benin in 2019, assisting the government with the arrest of three ships fishing illegally inside a marine park. These were the first arrests in Benin for illegal fishing, and the perpetrators were prosecuted and given the maximum penalty of a $50,000 fine. This case spurred legal reforms, increasing penalties for IUU fishing to over $1,000,000. Two years later, we assisted in the arrest of another two ships, which were prosecuted under the amended law. Each ship was fined over $250,000, and the captains were sentenced to 11 months of imprisonment. Since then, no further cases of illegal fishing have been detected in Benin. 4. The Gambia - Deterrence of Illegal Fishing: The Gambia's waters have been particularly vulnerable to IUU fishing activity. Out of the 98 vessels arrested for illegal fishing through our partnerships across Africa, 34 were apprehended in The Gambia. In early 2024 we assisted in the arrest of eight industrial trawlers, seven which were fishing inside of a Special Management Area reserved for artisanal fishermen (and where industrial fishing is outlawed), four which were using fishing nets with undersized mesh size, and all which had stopped transmitting their positions via the mandatory Automatic Identification System (AIS). In past patrols, vessels were found with hidden shark fins onboard, using illegal nets, and falsely labelling boxes of fish for export to the European market as “Sustainable Certified”. 5. Sierra Leone – Mass Exodus of Illegal Fishing Vessels: During our patrol in Sierra Leone in 2023, we saw 70 ships head back to port the moment we started patrolling, as they knew they wouldn’t pass a boarding. “I remember watching a parade of ships—dozens and dozens of them—filing into the Port of Freetown, because inspections were underway. The combined fishing efforts of seventy ships ground to a stop for the duration of the mission. It is the belief of Sea Shepherd Global that none of them had valid fishing licenses,” said Captain Peter Hammarstedt. 
We approach our relationships with care, sensitivity, and a service-oriented mentality, which has led to our partner governments advocating on our behalf to new potential partners. This continued patience and trust are crucial for achieving our goal of being a leading voice in conservation and legislative reform. Sea Shepherd strategically partners with countries based on several criteria to ensure our efforts have the greatest impact. We assess the potential partner's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), considering factors such as the prevalence of illegal fishing, the importance of their biodiversity, and economic impact on coastal communities. We evaluate the country's commitment to conservation and willingness to engage in partnership, prioritizing strong political will and collaboration readiness. We also consider whether partnering with the country would allow us to great impact on future conservation policies and create protected areas, leading to broader conservation efforts and policy reforms. Finally, we assess whether the partnership would open doors to other high-impact areas, encouraging neighboring countries to collaborate with us. 
Sea Shepherd’s successful track record in reducing IUU fishing activities in collaboration with various governments demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. However, to continue and expand our critical work, we require additional funds. This is how your support can make a profound difference in our fight against illegal fishing and its devastating impacts on marine ecosystems and coastal communities: 1. Expanding Our Reach: Your contribution will enable us to extend our operations to new regions heavily impacted by IUU fishing. By reaching more vulnerable areas, we can protect vital marine ecosystems and support coastal communities. 2. Enhancing Our Fleet and Technology: Donations will allow us to maintain and upgrade our vessels, equipping them with the latest technology for tracking and surveillance. This advanced equipment will significantly improve our ability to detect and respond to illegal activities, ensuring more effective enforcement. 3. Increasing Patrols and Capacity Building: With your support, we can increase the frequency and duration of our patrols, providing a consistent enforcement presence that deters illegal operators. Additionally, we can enhance our training and capacity-building programs, empowering local enforcement officials with the skills and knowledge needed to sustain anti-IUU fishing efforts independently. 4. Supporting New Partnerships: Establishing new partnerships requires initial investment in relationship-building, legal agreements, and logistical planning. Your funds will help us forge new collaborations with governments committed to combating IUU fishing, broadening our impact, and promoting sustainable fisheries management worldwide. This is how you can join us in protecting our oceans and ensuring a sustainable future for all marine life and coastal communities.

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,New rules tighten controls on EU…," Today, the Environmental Justice Foundation commends the European Commission for approving new rules that require stricter controls for landings by EU fishing vessels, providing new tools to prevent significant misreporting of unsorted catches when landing in selected ports, including those in third countries. It is welcome that the new rules require advanced and stricter control tools, such as CCTV to monitor landings, and set minimum benchmarks for the rates of inspection on trans-shipments. If properly implemented, this can increase transparency and accuracy in reporting by EU fleets that catch a large number of species, including those that have been overfished, such as yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean. Sean Parramore, Senior EU Advocacy Officer at the Environmental Justice Foundation, said: ""Stricter control measures on landings by EU vessels that have more leeway to misreport their catches are critical to prevent hidden overfishing. In the long run, everyone loses if we open the door to fish fraud. Fish stocks will collapse and the EU's credibility in its efforts to promote sustainable fisheries on the world stage will be severely undermined. These new rules can help prevent that.“ A first list of ports is to be adopted by July 2024, following input from EU Member States. Sean Parramore added: “When selecting ports, it is crucial that there is sufficient evidence that the conditions approved today are actually in place. This will be key for the EU to continue leading by example in fighting unreported fishing globally.” ENDS Notes to editors EJF works internationally to inform policy and drive systemic, durable reforms to protect our environment and defend human rights.

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,"N.S. boat captain, 2 companies fined $125K for fisheries violations"," A boat captain from Sambro, N.S., with a history of fishery convictions has been fined $60,000 and banned from fishing for six months for five violations that included a secret, middle-of-the-night offload of halibut. The case involved misreporting of halibut, hake and cod catch from trips on board the fishing boat Ivy Lew between May 2019 and June 2020. Casey Henneberry, 40, and ALS Fisheries and Law Fisheries were found guilty last October by Halifax provincial court Judge Elizabeth Buckle. The sentence was handed down in court last month and posted this week. ""Mr. Henneberry's offending conduct is that he inaccurately logged and hailed weight of groundfish on four trips over approximately one year and on one of those trips, he illegally off-loaded $40,000 worth of halibut, intending to sell it,"" Buckle said in her written sentence. On that trip, DFO officers were observing the Ivy Lew and intercepted the illegal off-load in Sambro. During the attempted arrests of those involved, Henneberry fled and was arrested later, the judge noted in sentencing. During this period the groundfish licence was held first by Law Fisheries and then ALS Fisheries. The companies were fined $55,000 and $10,000 respectively for failing to ensure licence conditions were complied with. ALS Fisheries owns the Ivy Lew, which has been held for the past three years by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, likely as security on any fine. The company has continued to pay on the $1-million mortgage on the vessel. Henneberry is a lifelong fisherman with hundreds of trips as a captain. He does not own any fishing business, but earns $150,000 a year as a captain — money used to pay child support and for therapy and assistance for a child with developmental challenges. Henneberry has three prior convictions for failing to observe licence conditions, including failing to hail out (or provide notification a trip is underway), possession of undersized halibut and several other instances of misreporting. The crown wanted a fine of $140,000 and a two-year licence suspension for Henneberry. Buckle said the fact that he is financially responsible for his family and fully engaged in his child's life is a mitigating factor. He has five years to pay the fine. In her decision, Buckle said in 2019, ALS had four directors who were all related to Henneberry. Each of its four directors have prior convictions for Fisheries Act offences. Two are also directors of Law Fisheries. The Crown did not allege prior record for either company. Buckle said both companies' ""annual quota for groundfish is a significant share of the fleet allowance and has substantial value."" The Crown argued their corporate conduct appeared intentional and at the very least amounted to gross negligence. It sought a fine of $30,000 for ALS and $180,000 for Law. Buckle acknowledged the lack of diligence by the companies, which failed ""to do anything to oversee their licences in circumstances where they should have been extra vigilant. ""However, I am not persuaded that they were involved in a deliberate effort to thwart the regulations, that they had intent or knowledge of the offences or were purposefully indifferent to their obligations."" She also addressed the crown submission that all the ALS directors were previously the directors of a defunct company that was convicted of fisheries offences in 2006, sentenced to pay fines of over $600,000 but discontinued operations and never paid its fines. ""I accept the Crown's submission that this is relevant to the need for specific deterrence and speaks to the effectiveness of corporate fines alone as deterrents. However, the fact that DFO holds the Ivy Lew as security makes it likely that any fine against ALS will be paid.""

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,"Move the IUU Fight Up the Food Chain | Proceedings - November 2023 Vol. 149/11/1,449",,2023-10-31
Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,Surprise! Media is misreporting the source of a Dutch cargo ship fire," Early this morning, the Fremantle Highway, a vehicle carrying cargo ship, caught fire in the North Sea, off the coast of Ameland in the Netherlands. The fire has killed one person on board and injured several more, though all 23 crew members have at this point been evacuated from the ship. Currently, the fire is still burning and the cause of the fire is unknown, according to the Dutch Coast Guard, which is carrying out the firefighting operation. But media reports, seeming to all crib from the same misquote, would have you think otherwise. The Fremantle Highway is a “roll-on/roll-off,” or “RoRo,” ship, a vehicle carrier designed for cars to drive on and off of it in loading and unloading. According to early reports, it was carrying 2,832 gas-powered cars, complete with a large amount of volatile energy stored in their collective gas tanks (some is needed to drive on and off of the ship) and in the tank of the ship itself, and 25 electric cars, from Germany to Egypt (those numbers have now been updated to 3,783 cars, including 498 EVs – which shows the peril of reporting on things like this with incomplete information). Naturally, the media seems to have taken one statement from the Dutch Coast Guard and misinterpreted it, jumping to exactly the premature conclusion that you probably did when you saw this headline pop up. An early article about the cargo ship fire quoted Lea Versteeg, a spokesperson for the Dutch Coast Guard, as having made this statement over the phone: It’s carrying cars, 2,857, of which 25 are electrical cars, which made the fire even more difficult. It’s not easy to keep that kind of fire under control and even in such a vessel it’s not easy. This quote seems reasonable. We’re not sure who made the phone call, but since it’s in the Associated Press article, we suspect they might be the first who got this statement directly from Versteeg’s mouth. What the quote seems to mean is that in a ship full of vehicles, each of which is carrying their own at least partially full energy storage container (whether that be a gas tank or a battery), it’s going to be hard to put out a fire because there is a lot of fuel available for that fire. Further, given that there is a mix of fuels, it’s hard to pick a single tactic to put all of them out at once, because firefighting methods are different for different types of fires. What the quote clearly doesn’t mean is that the Coast Guard is blaming this fire on an electric car. And how do we know that? Well, we called their media line and asked them. And they told us that, no, they have not made a statement to that effect, because they don’t know the cause of the fire yet, and that this seems to be speculation in the media. We also checked the Dutch Coast Guard’s liveblog about the firefighting efforts, and their Twitter page, and neither said anything about electric cars. In fact, the liveblog has now been updated to say “the cause of the fire is still unknown.” And it makes sense that the Coast Guard would not know yet what the source of the fire is, and it would be unprofessional of them to say so, given that the fire isn’t even contained yet. But NOS, the Dutch public broadcaster, cites a “Coast Guard spokesperson” as saying that presumably the fire was started by an EV. But unlike AP, NOS does not name the spokesperson nor does it have a direct quote from said spokesperson. So we really don’t know whether NOS talked to a spokesperson, or is cribbing from the Versteeg quote above – and changing its meaning in the process. And several other articles have run with this mysteriously unsourced quote, which conflicts with the Coast Guard’s actual statement, putting this nonexistent suspicion into their headlines. Reuters echoed NOS’s statement in its original article on the fire, but in a more recent article, it has now walked that back, stating “the coastguard said on its website that the cause of the fire was unknown, but a coastguard spokesperson had earlier told Reuters it began near an electric car” (emphasis ours). And various more-ideological publications, especially those associated with climate denial, are leaning hard into claiming an EV is the cause as well. So let’s take stock: Given this information, we must conclude that this is being misreported based on the evidence available at the time of publication. This is unfortunately not the first time we’ve seen something like this happen. Just off the top of my head: One thing we do know is that cargo ship fires are not uncommon, with hundreds happening last year. We also know that another cargo ship carrying ~1,200 gas cars (and zero electric) caught fire earlier this month in New Jersey, killing two. And we know that gasoline is literally supposed to combust, that’s its entire purpose, and it does, commonly, since gas cars are more likely to catch fire than EVs are, with hundreds of thousands of gas car fires every year in the US, virtually none of which get reported. And yet, you probably have a strong association in your subconscious between fires and electric cars. This association is why events like the aforementioned reporting on the 1,200-car ship had to specifically mention that “there were no electric cars on board.” Because the last time a ship made headlines for burning, it was one that had a lot of electric cars on board (and notably also several gas-powered Lamborghini Aventadors, which have been recalled for fires). And despite burning ships being a not-uncommon event, this one made so many headlines precisely because of the nature of the electric cars on board. That event also had several early reports laying blame on said electric cars, but that was also early speculation, by media, never by official authorities, and the cause of that fire is still unclear to this day. But the association remains. There is a concept in journalism that is summarized as “Man Bites Dog.” The saying goes that you would never report on a dog biting a man, because that’s a common occurrence, but if a man bites a dog, well, that’s interesting and rare, so that belongs in the paper. What this means is that news tends to magnify rare events, and de-emphasize common ones. And in our media-saturated landscape, where everyone is constantly being bombarded by headlines that they don’t have the time or inclination to analyze (thank you to the ~.1% of people who saw the headline and actually clicked and read through to this sentence), this leads people to have a warped view of the commonality of certain events. Unfortunately, in writing this article, we have become part of the problem. By posting about fires in an electric vehicle publication, we have created an association in the minds of anyone who sees this headline between electric cars and fires. Sure the media has jumped well ahead of the facts.  That said this article is a weird kind of overcompensation with its own assumptions and errors  So let's talk about shipping industry practice which is to severely restrict the transport of electric vehicles on Ro-Ro.  (I've dealt with this personally trying to ship a vehicle transatlantic).  They continue to be very concerned about the difficulties of extinguishing lithium battery fires since the procedures and equipment are still in their infancy.  Those involved in industrial safety knows that safety is a bunch of layers of protection.  Frequency (the only one mentioned by the author), is only one consideration in assessing overall risk. Which is why persistent associations like these are so hard to shake. Even the debunking itself can reinforce the association, through a concept known as the “backfire effect.” Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet to combat this. But being aware of the problem helps us confront it in our own brains, and here are some better media consumption practices we can follow: And that goes double for journalists. This is your job, that phone call to the press line took all of a minute of my time to clear that up. The tweet was another couple minutes to find because I had to search for “kustwacht” instead of “Coast Guard.” The liveblog was a few minutes because it was slammed with more traffic than the Dutch Coast Guard usually has to deal with. None of this took longer than the amount of time it takes to write an article… but it did take longer than it takes to react with a 140-character quip via tweet. And thus, as the famous saying goes, “the lie travels halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes” (which, fittingly, is another misquote – Twain didn’t say it).

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,Sea Shepherd Global," Monday, 25 Mar, 2024 In a decisive strike against illegal fishing, The Gambia Navy, supported by Sea Shepherd's vessel Age of Union, apprehended eight industrial trawlers off the coast of The Gambia for severe violations of fisheries laws. On the 8th of March, armed maritime interdiction units with The Gambia Navy were deployed from the Sea Shepherd ship Age of Union in a law enforcement sweep that netted eight industrial trawlers for serious fisheries offenses ranging from fishing inside of protected waters, fishing without a valid license, using undersized mesh size and misreporting catch. The series of arrests occurred over a 24-hour period, as Gambia Navy sailors launched a coordinated sting operation based on weeks of intelligence gathering by the Ministry of Defense in the West African country of The Gambia. Fishing vessels Majilac 03, Majilac 05, Majilac 06, Majilac 07, Zherui 100612, Hao Yun 1, Hao Yun 2 and Hai Hao 2 were all caught in the bust and are presently detained in the Port of Banjul. Seven of the eight vessels were arrested for fishing inside of a Special Management Area reserved for artisanal fishermen, and where industrial fishing is outlawed. Four of the vessels were using fishing nets with undersized mesh size. 
                “The Gambia implements mesh size requirements to ensure that undersized and juvenile fish can escape, thereby conserving fish populations to mitigate overfishing. But at-sea patrols are needed to ensure compliance as well as deterring industrial trawlers from entering protected areas.”
             The waters of The Gambia are particularly rich in biodiversity as the country is positioned where the nutrient-rich Gambia River meets the Canary Current. The livelihoods of over 300,000 Gambians are directly or indirectly dependent on local fisheries while the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UN FAO) believes that more than 46% of the assessed fish populations in the Eastern Central Atlantic are experiencing overfishing. Sardinella and other small pelagic species are of critical importance to Gambians which is why the government instituted a twelve-nautical mile Special Management Area to conserve waters frequented by artisanal fishermen. However, industrialized trawlers routinely come close to the shoreline where small-scale fishers regularly see the fishing lights from beach communities. The Ministry of Defense often receives reports from artisanal fishermen about trawlers fishing in no-go zones. Populations of sardinella are also rapidly declining due to these daily incursions as industrialized trawlers take far more fish than fishers in paddle canoes can. None of the arrested vessels were transmitting their position using their automatic identification system, a mandatory transponder that allows law enforcement to track vessel movements. 
                “Sea Shepherd commends the actions of The Gambian government in taking strong action against industrial trawlers that circumvent laws, fishing in protected areas and jeopardizing the livelihoods of local communities. Since the arrests, our captain and crew are reporting that all other industrialized trawlers are keeping outside of the Special Management Area, where The Gambia Navy continues to stand watch from Age of Union.”
             Operation Gambian Coastal Defense is a unique partnership with the government of The Gambia that started in 2019 to conduct joint at sea patrols to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Since 2016, Sea Shepherd has worked in partnership with the governments of Gabon, Liberia, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe, Tanzania, Benin, Namibia and The Gambia to combat IUU fishing by providing the use of civilian offshore patrol vessels to African coastal and island States so that authorities can enforce fisheries regulations and conservation laws in their sovereign waters. To date, the unique partnerships have resulted in the arrest of 96 vessels for illegal fishing and other fisheries crimes. Scroll down to watch the arrest video!

The NDP Member of Parliament was met with applause over the ongoing controversy surrounding the monopolization of B.C.’s fishing industry and foreign ownership. “Commercial fishing licences shouldn’t be treated like a private stock market controlled by big corporations,” he said. In 2019, the Committee on Fisheries and Oceans put forward 20 recommendations to reform the way commercial fishing licences and quotas are distributed in B.C. The aim was to address concerns of monopolization – including limiting ownership by foreign investors who may have never stepped on a fishing boat. Liberal MP Ken Hardie described the current commercial fishing system in B.C. as “a modern-day feudal system.” Central to the discussion is the Individual Transferrable Quota System (ITQ), which is a transferable quota of fish, meaning that the owner can either fill the quota by fishing, or sell the quota to someone else. Only Canadian citizens or permanent residents can have fishing licences, but foreign companies are allowed to buy and sell ITQs without government interference. It turns out that buying and selling ITQs is very profitable. In 2015 for example, halibut ITQs were leased out for $7-9/lb when the actual price of the fish was $8.25-9.50/lb. This means that owners took over 85 per cent of the total value, leaving fishermen with incredibly small profits to pay their crews, maintain their ships and buy supplies. Also central to the issue is a declining population of salmon thanks to compounding problems such as climate change and habitat loss, according to the 2019 report State of Canadian Pacific Salmon. Despite the 2019 recommendations, the Liberal government has not implemented a single change,” Bachrach said. “There’s a huge opportunity here, Mr. Speaker, for people, for communities. We need the political will to get this done.” In 2007, the Stephen Harper government reformed its Atlantic fisheries to ensure that the benefits of licences stay with the fish harvesters and the communities where they live. Some changes enacted in 2007 include immediate inspection for vessels caught misreporting their catch and sanctions for vessel owners such as fines or suspension of licences or seizing fishing gear or the illegal catch. Bachrach is hoping that similar changes are applied in B.C. “The maximum value of the fish that get caught should go to the people that do the work and B.C.’s catch should be processed in B.C. communities,” he said.

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,Fish and Overfishing," How are fish stocks changing across the world? How much is overfished? By: Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser This article was first published in October 2021 and last updated in March 2024. Many thanks to Ray Hilborn, Michael Melnychuk, Max Mossler, and Daniel Hively from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database for providing data and feedback for this project. See all interactive charts on fish and overfishing ↓ Other research and writing on fish and overfishing on Our World in Data: The world produces around 200 million tonnes of fish and seafood every year. This comes from a combination of wild fish catch and fish farming. In fact, the rapid growth of aquaculture over the last few decades means we now produce more seafood from fish farms than we do from fisheries. Which countries produce the most seafood? We can break this down by wild catch and fish farming. But let’s first look at total production from the sum of these two methods. This is shown in the map here. China is the world’s largest seafood producer. The chart here shows the distribution of wild fish catch by country. This is total seafood production minus aquaculture (fish farming). By clicking on any country, you can see how its production has changed over time. The two charts here show the distribution of fish farming (also known as ‘aquaculture’) by country. First is the global distribution, as shown on the map. Second, as in the regional breakdown, you can also add and compare countries using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Most of the world’s growth in aquaculture production has come from East Asia and the Pacific. For example, China produces more food from aquaculture than any other country. This growth in aquaculture has played an important role in increasing global seafood production without sacrificing fish stocks. Production has continued to grow while the output of wild fisheries has slowed or even plateaued. This allows us to maintain sustainable fishing levels that do not deplete wild fish populations. Most records of global fish catch only date back decades. But, of course, fishing is an industry that dates back much further. We don't have good global records that go so far back in time, but we can draw upon data from some rich countries that have statistical records dating back centuries. This gives us insights into how modern-day fishing compares to the more distant past. In the chart here, we see five centuries of cod catch in Eastern Canada.1 These fishing records date back to the year 1500. We see that fish catch started to increase from around 1700 through to the mid-20th century. It peaked in 1968 before a collapse in fish stocks led to a dramatic decline. In fact, fisheries were forced to close 24 years later, in the early 1990s. Since then, stocks have not been able to recover due to the reopening of fisheries and their overexploitation afterward. Historical records from the UK give us a further understanding of the long-term trend in fisheries. In their paper, published in Nature, researchers Ruth Thurstan and colleagues reconstruct UK fisheries trends dating back more than a century.2 This measures the catch of bottom-dwelling fish – excluding shellfish. We see a steep rise in fish catch over the first half of the 20th century. The development of steam trawlers in the 1880s allowed vessels to fish further offshore, for longer periods of time, and with gear that could reach deeper into the ocean. This increase in fish catch was interrupted by the two World Wars: we see the dramatic declines in catch shown on the chart. This inter-war decline was due to a couple of factors: fishing became much more dangerous, and vessels were redirected from fishing towards military and other uses.3 Even after the World Wars, the fish catch began to dramatically decline over the second half of the 20th century. We might hypothesize that this decline was the result of reduced fishing efforts. But, this is not reflected in the data on fishing activity. When we look at the amount of fish caught per unit of fishing power (the number of fishing vessels multiplied by the fishing effort per vessel) we also see a dramatic decline. This shows the reduction in catch has been driven by a decline in the availability of bottom-living fish rather than changes in fishing efforts. Say the word ‘fishing’, and very different images come to mind. Some of us might picture a lone fisherman with a wooden fishing rod. Others will picture a 100-meter-wide net being dragged along the seafloor by an industrial ship. There are a variety of ways to catch fish. These matters because they depend on what fish we want to catch, how much fish we can catch (and ultimately, the amount of fish we have to eat and the income fishers get), and what the ecological impacts are. Discussions on fisheries can be full of jargon. If you’re not familiar with this research, it can be difficult to understand exactly what each method looks like and what it entails. To make this easier, I have created the following visualization, which presents an overview of the most common fishing methods. This is based on summary visuals from the Marine Stewardship Council. This gear is used across the world, but there are some general patterns where certain methods are more widely used. Pole-and-line, longline, and gillnet methods are more common in lower-income countries where much of the fishing activity is subsistence or small-scale. Purse seine and trawling methods are more common in industrial fishing practices; these tend to catch more fish per unit of effort. However, the downside is that they tend to have larger negative impacts, with more bycatch (catch of fish that are not the target species) and, in some cases, damage to the seabed. Now that we have some understanding of what each of these methods means, let’s look at how common each is. In the charts, we see the breakdown of global wild fish catch by the type of fishing gear used. This data is sourced from the Sea Around Us database, published by Daniel Pauly, Dirk Zeller, and Maria Palomares.4 Globally, bottom trawling is the most common method, accounting for one-quarter of fish catch. Pelagic (midwater) trawling accounts for an additional 10%. This means all types of trawling account for just over one-third of global fish catch. Purse seine fishing is the second most common method, accounting for just over 20% of the catch. Gillnets and longlines account for much less of global fish catch. This is partly a result of the fact that they achieve less catch per landing than methods such as trawling or purse seine. It’s interesting to see how common methods are across different countries. You can explore this data for any country using the + ‘Edit countries and regions’ on the interactive charts. For example, we see that bottom trawling is the dominant method used in China. In contrast, bottom trawling is becoming less common across Europe. In many countries – such as the UK, Spain, and Portugal – bottom trawling was intense throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s but has since declined significantly. That has been partly driven by efforts to reduce overfishing and allow fish stocks to rebuild. In addition, the European Commission banned bottom trawling in deep waters – those below 800m in depth – in 2016. In countries where most fishing is subsistent – Bangladesh is one example – it’s small-scale fishing practices that dominate. Large-scale practices are almost non-existent. Finally, we see that larger-scale practices are growing in some countries as they transition from small, subsistence fishing to larger industrial practices. In Ghana, for example, purse seine is one of the most common forms of fishing. Fish and seafood is an important source of nutrition for many people across the world. Not only does it provide an important source of protein, but fish also contains other nutrients and vitamins that are important for overall health, such as vitamin A, calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.5 How much fish do people across the world eat, and how much of our nutrition does it provide? Some countries in the world eat close to 100 kilograms of seafood per person each year. Others average only a few kilograms. In the charts here, we see the average per capita consumption of fish and seafood across the world.6 The highest seafood consumers are countries including Iceland, the Maldives, and Hong Kong. Contrast that with those at the bottom of the table: landlocked countries such as Mongolia, Afghanistan, and Niger understandably eat relatively little fish. There is a strong relationship between income and overall meat consumption: as we get richer, we tend to eat more meat. This relationship is not as strong for seafood. Many lower-income countries rely on subsistence fishing as a key food source. How much of our total protein, from plant and animal sources, comes from seafood? In the chart here, we see the per capita protein intake from different sources across the world. Globally, less than 10% of total protein intake comes from seafood.7 In some countries, it accounts for a much larger share: around one-third in the Maldives and one-fifth in Japan, Iceland, and Cambodia. It’s possible to get all of the protein we need from plant sources. However, to get all of the amino acids (the building blocks of protein) from a plant-based diet, one needs to have the right variety of foods. It requires a balance of staples such as cereals and more complete proteins such as legumes (peas and beans). Unfortunately, many in poorer countries are heavily reliant on cereals and lack this dietary diversity. In this case, animal protein sources can be vitally important for human health. So, how much of our animal protein comes from seafood? Globally, around one-sixth of our animal protein comes from seafood.7 In the charts here, we see the breakdown of animal protein consumption by country. In some countries, seafood dominates. It accounts for the majority of animal protein in Cambodia, Bangladesh, and the Maldives. For billions of people across the world, fish is an important source of nutrition. Fish plays an important role in nutrition for communities across the world. For many, it is a key source of high-quality protein and provides other vital micronutrients for health. However, people also rely on fishing and fish farming as primary sources of income. How many people are employed in these industries? The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates around 60 million people globally are employed as fishers (catching wild fish) or fish farming (aquaculture). The breakdown of employment by region and the split between fisheries and fish farming is shown in the chart. More people are employed in wild catch than fish farming: a difference of 39 million to 21 million. Unsurprisingly, Asia is home to most of the world’s fishers and fish farmers. The following chart shows us how employment has changed over recent decades. Globally, employment in the industry has increased, but with much faster growth in aquaculture. In 1995, fish farming was a relatively small industry, but it has grown rapidly in the last few decades. More of our seafood now comes from aquaculture than from wild catch. Employment in fishing has increased in every region except Europe. The number of fishers across Europe peaked around the year 2000 and has markedly declined since then [you can view these trends by region using the blue “Change region” button]. The seafood industry is not only an important source of nutrition for many; it is also a key source of income for millions of people. Both those employed directly as fishers or fish farmers and those employed through indirect jobs such as food processing, sourcing, and the management of fisheries. Is the global fishing industry sustainable? Which types of fish are we harvesting sustainably, and where are we overfishing? These are critical questions, but to answer them, we need to first agree on what ‘sustainability’ actually means when it comes to fishing. One of the biggest conflicts I see is not actually about technical discussions of how much fish we catch or whether populations are increasing or decreasing, but a larger ethical conflict in how we view fish. When we view fish through different lenses, these debates don’t get very far. One school of thought views fish as animals with their own inherent value. In this realm, our end goal is often to restore wild animal populations to as close to their pre-human levels as possible. Ultimately, this means we should be catching very little (if any at all). The other school of thought views fish as a resource. Most of us eat fish; hundreds of millions rely on it for nutrition and income across the world. This is incompatible with restoring populations to their historical levels because we can’t do that and catch lots of fish at the same time. Sustainability, in this view, means catching as many fish as possible without depleting fish populations any further. This ties in with the classic Brundtland definition of sustainability: “meeting the needs of the current generation, without sacrificing the needs of future generations”. We catch as many fish as possible to meet the needs of people alive today but don’t take too much such that populations decline, and this sacrifices catch for future generations. We can see these two schools of thought emerge in the typical diagram of sustainable fishing. On the x-axis, we have fishing pressure; as we move towards the right, we catch a larger proportion of the fish stock each year. Fishing pressure tells us about the fraction of the fish population that is caught in a given year. Note that this measure is a flow – it is an input variable that changes over time. On the y-axis, we have fish biomass, which is given as two variables. First, we have the fish catch – shown as the red line. This, again, is a flow variable. Second, we have fish stocks. The fish stock is the total amount of fish left in the population. It, as we'd expect, is a stock variable. Let’s first look at the ‘stock’ line. This is the amount of fish we have in the oceans. It slopes downwards towards the right: if we fish very little, then lots of fish are left in the ocean, and as we increase fishing pressure, we deplete the amount of fish in our oceans. This makes sense. Our first school of thought – that fish are not a resource but a wild animal population in their own right – suggests we should be aiming for the top-left corner. Fish populations are as close to pre-human levels as possible. To do this, we need to catch very little (if any) fish. Our second school of thought – that fish are a resource – would consider the optimal level to be the red dot. This is what is called the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. This is a key concept in fishery research and industry. It’s the largest long-term average catch that can be taken from a fish stock under prevailing environmental and fishery conditions. If you get greedy and catch more than this, then you deplete populations for future generations. If you catch too little, then you’re sacrificing food and income for the current generation. Most fisheries are aiming for this sweet spot: catching not too much, not too little, just right. The tension between these two schools becomes obvious. The optimal outcome is completely different. When the biomass of a fish stock is at the point where the ‘maximum sustainable yield’ can be achieved, it’s around half of its original virgin biomass.8 This level can vary between fish populations but is typically in the range of 37% to 50% of its pre-fishing levels. This may seem counterintuitive, but wild animal population growth rates are often greatest when the population size is moderate and before the population starts to reach its natural limit, or carrying capacity. In other words, if you view fish as a resource, you probably want fish populations to be less than half the size of pre-fishing size in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield. Most of the research, industry, and policymaking is geared towards the second school: viewing fish as a resource. Therefore, much of our work on fish on Our World in Data will explore these concepts and explain what the research and data tell us about fish stocks, catch, and the sustainability of fishing across the world. However, we will also offer the perspective of the first school by looking at how fish populations have changed from their pre-human levels. Sustainable fishing, by its fisheries definition, is catching just the right amount. If you harvest too much, then fish stocks decline. If you catch too little, then you’re giving up valuable food resources and income. In the previous section, we take a closer look at different concepts of sustainable fishing and how this ‘sweet spot’ – the maximum sustainable yield – is defined. How much of the world’s fish is caught sustainably? This is often measured in terms of fish stocks. A fish stock is a subpopulation of a particular species of fish with common parameters such as location, growth, and mortality. Often, it’s a species of fish in a given location. Indian Ocean tuna, for example. Importantly, this metric treats each fish stock as being equal, regardless of how big each stock is. A stock where we catch 1000 tonnes is counted the same as a stock where we catch 10 tonnes. When defining the sustainability of fisheries, we need to know three terms: Overfished: this is sometimes termed ‘overexploited’. A fish stock with abundance below the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is potentially considered ""overfished"". Fish stocks become overexploited when fish are caught at a rate higher than the fish population can support. Maximally sustainably fished: this has sometimes been termed ‘fully fished’ or ‘fully exploited’ in the past. Some might interpret these terms negatively, but this is actually the ‘sweet spot’ that fisheries are aiming for. This is the maximum sustainable yield, where we’re catching as much fish as possible without reducing fish populations below the most productive level. Underfished: this is when the fish stock is greater than the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield. We could catch more fish without the decline of fish populations. From a resource point of view, this is suboptimal because we’re missing out on a key food source and income source from fishing communities. The breakdown of these three categories is shown in the chart. Combined, underfished and maximally fished would be considered to be sustainable because fish stocks are not declining. One-third (34%) of assessed global fish stocks were overfished in 2017. However, 60% were maximally fished, and 6% were underfished. But this does not tell us how much fish was sourced sustainably. This is because fish stocks can be very different sizes. Let’s say we have two fish stocks. Stock A is sustainable, and we’re catching 80 tonnes of fish per year. Stock B is unsustainable, and we’re catching 20 tonnes from it. If we aggregate them, we’d conclude that only half of our fish stocks are sustainable, but 80% of our catch is. When we adjust for the different amounts of catch from each stock, we find that almost four-fifths (79%) of fish catch is sourced sustainably. 21% of the catch comes from overfished populations. Overall, two-thirds of assessed fisheries are sustainable, providing four-fifths of our seafood. This gives us a static view of global fisheries, but how has this been changing over time? Are things getting worse? The chart here shows the status of the world’s fish stocks from the 1970s. The share of overfished stocks has increased over the last half-century. In the 1970s, around 10% were overexploited. Although exploitation rates varied year-to-year, this generally increased through the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Over recent decades, there has been some variability, but overfishing has hovered around one-third globally. Some regions are fishing much more sustainably than others. In the following section, we look at which are managing well and which are doing poorly. Sometimes, there are claims that seem so far-fetched that it’s hard to imagine they need to be addressed. But this is one that simply won’t die – it has been repeated so many times that many believe it to be true. It hit the headlines again after being featured in the popular Netflix documentary Seaspiracy earlier this year. It made the claim that: ""If current fishing trends continue, we will see virtually empty oceans by the year 2048"". Seaspiracy is far from the first source to repeat this claim: Google “empty oceans by 2048,” and you will find hundreds of thousands of results. What’s the story here? Where did this claim come from, and is it true? In 2006, the fisheries researcher Boris Worm and his colleagues published a paper in Science on the trends in biodiversity loss in the world’s oceans.9 The year 2048 and prospects for ‘global collapse’, were only mentioned once and featured in the conclusion of the article: Our data highlight the societal consequences of an ongoing erosion of diversity that appears to be accelerating on a global scale. This trend is of serious concern because it projects the global collapse of all taxa currently fished by the mid–21st century (based on the extrapolation of regression to 100% in the year 2048). How did they reach this conclusion? Well, they plotted the historical decline in ‘collapsed taxa’, as shown in the chart. If we take this black trend line and continue extrapolating it into the future, it will cross 100% in 2048. In other words, if we assume taxa continued to collapse at a constant rate, it would reach zero by mid-century. This raises the important question of what the authors meant by the term ‘collapse’ and how it was calculated. They defined a ‘collapse’ as the case where fish catch was below 10% of their historical recorded maximum. Their data came from the UN FAO database on fisheries ‘landings’ (the amount of fish brought back to land). At the time, there was a lack of high-quality data on fish abundance, so there was only catch data to go on. Unfortunately, this somewhat broad-brush projection was the highlight picked up by the media. The New York Times ran the headline “Study Sees 'Global Collapse' of Fish Species"", and coverage snowballed from there. Even if the authors’ projection did come true, and fisheries did collapse by 2048, the leap to “the oceans will be empty in 2048” is scientifically implausible. The definition of a fisheries collapse is not an ocean of no fish. Catch may be low because populations have been depleted. But there are clearly still fish: we're still catching them. Obviously, this is not an optimal place to be, whether you care about the fish or the fishers. But it does not mean an empty ocean. As we will see later, this prediction has not played out in reality. The aftermath of their paper in 2006 created a lot of uproar in the fishery research community. There were many rebuttal papers challenging this position. The research community had previously been divided: one camp had a more optimistic take on the status of the world’s fisheries and prospects for the future; one had a more pessimistic take. Boris Worm fell into the latter. To their credit, these two sides soon joined forces, working collaboratively to get a much larger and more rigorous overview of the status of the world’s fish populations. The figureheads on both sides of the debate – Ray Hilborn and Boris Worm – both featured in a debate on National Public Radio. In the aftermath, they formed a collaborative project facilitated by the National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis (NCEAS) to get to the bottom of it. Rather than relying on reported data on fish catch, the scientists set out to build a database on global fish stocks. This does not focus on the amount of fish being caught but the abundance of fish in each population. Scientists can do this through a combination of sonar acoustic methods (which lets them build a picture of the number and density of fish) and fishing (which lets them identify specific species in the ecosystem). They published their results in 2009 in the journal Science.10 They concluded that although around two-thirds of assessed fisheries are below the biomass that would give us the maximum sustainable yield, catch is now within or even below sustainable levels in 7 of the 10 studied ecosystems. In other words, while many stocks are still in a poor state, things are improving across many ecosystems. The decline that Worm et al. projected in their earlier paper has not come true. Many fisheries are in a stable position and do not follow the projected curve of collapse. The divergence of these two trends is shown in the chart. First, in red, we see the observations in the Worm et al. (2006) paper from UN FAO catch data. We see that by extrapolating the trend line, it will reach 100% in 2048. In blue, we see the more recent data from Worm and Hilborn’s collaboration on fish stock (abundance) data. It shows a more stable trend in collapse stocks over the last few decades. This mirrors the UN FAO's assessment of fisheries. It estimates that around one-third of the world’s fish stocks are overexploited: these populations are declining because we’re catching more fish than can reproduce. The other two-thirds, though, are sustainable and not in decline. The share that is overexploited has been relatively stable in recent decades. It has not continued at the rates predicted. The most recent analysis of global fish stocks – published by the same group in 2020 – reaffirms this result.11 There are certainly fish stocks that are of major concern. But overall, the majority of regions where we have high-quality data are at least stable.12 To be clear, this does not undermine the fact that some of the world’s fish populations are struggling. Many are in trouble and are at risk of collapse if we do not take action. But the notion that the world’s fisheries will collapse within decades is wrong. Even the original authors do not stand by this statement.13 The extrapolation of this original claim to the “oceans will be empty by 2048” is nonsense that does not reflect the science that underpins it. The health of the world’s fish populations is one of our biggest concerns when it comes to the sustainability of fishing. Compared to other meats, seafood has a low environmental footprint when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and nutrient pollution – we looked at this later on. But with wild fish populations, we have another dimension to consider: what’s happening to their population numbers. When we catch fish faster than they can reproduce, these numbers decline. Earlier on, we looked at assessments of overfishing, and we found that around one-third of global fish stocks are overfished. [A ‘fish stock’ is a fish population in a given location – Bluefin Tuna in the Pacific Ocean, for example]. This is useful but doesn’t really tell us how fish stocks around the world are doing. As consumers, we want to know what types of fish to buy or where to source them. At the industry, national, or global level, we want to know this so we can take action on the stocks that are not doing well. What do we know about the health of fish stocks across the world? There are several methods we use to better understand the health of fish stocks. One method is small-scale scientific surveys in specific regions. This certainly gives us some indication of fish populations, but they are often localized and don’t give us a complete health profile. The second is to do large-scale stock assessments. These assessments have become the bedrock of fisheries management. The RAM Legacy database – first launched in 2009 – is led by a team at the University of Washington – and is the most widely used in research and is adopted by the UN Fisheries Division. Back in 2009, it covered 166 of the world’s fish stocks, which accounted for around 20% of global fish catch.10 Today, it covers over 1,200 fish stocks, which is more than 50% of the global catch. It covers many of the world’s key fishing regions: the United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Europe, Peru, Chile, Argentina, high-seas tuna fisheries, New Zealand, and Japan, plus most of the major fisheries of South Africa and Australia. Unfortunately, there are key regions where we have very little data. The database is missing data from most Asian, African, and Latin American fisheries. We see this in the map, which details the coverage of fish stocks in the RAM database. Most fisheries across Europe and the Americas have good coverage. Most fisheries across Asia do not. We will soon look at what’s happening to fish stocks in the regions for which we have good data. But first we should see what we know (if anything) about the stocks that are missing. Stock assessments are used by fisheries across the world to understand the health of fish populations and implement strategies to manage their fisheries. For example, they might be used to set catch limits at levels that are sustainable, given the dynamics and health of the fish population. They are carried out using the ‘ABC’ method. This is the collection of three key metrics: A = Abundance. Scientists use acoustics and other methods to monitor and estimate the abundance of fish at any given time. B = Biological factors. Sampled fish are taken to assess the age and population growth rate of the population. For example, we might need to know the ratio of adult versus juvenile fish to estimate the reproduction rate of the population. C = Catch. Data is collected on how many fish are being caught. Scientists then used these three inputs – abundance, biology, and catch – to model the population dynamics of the fish stock. Abundance and biology tell us how many fish we would otherwise expect to be there before we remove any. Catch tells us how many we’re taking out. The balance of these two gives us an estimate of how many there really are. We don't have good stock assessments across Asia, Africa (except South Africa), and much of Latin America. But can we say anything about how they might be doing? Well, first, the very fact that we don’t have good data is itself bad news. Managing the sustainability of fisheries is a delicate process – to do it well we need continual monitoring of the fish populations, their reproduction rate, and how much fish we’re catching. This balance can change from season to season or even month to month as environmental factors change and affect the dynamics of the ecosystem. Regions that manage fisheries well are constantly monitoring and changing catch limits when necessary. Fisheries that are not carrying out these assessments will struggle to maintain this balance. That’s most of the fisheries across Asia, Africa, and South America. Fishing pressure in many of these regions is intense. Bottom-trawling – where large fishing nets are dragged along the seabed – is very high in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia. Maintaining such high rates of fishing without monitoring them closely makes it unlikely that fish stocks are in a healthy state. One of the ways that we can assess the pressure from trawling is to look at how many times a given area of the seabed is trawled. Some areas are only trawled once every few years. Others are trawled over and over. Research suggests that where stocks are healthy, a net only passes over the same spot once in a period of 3 to 10 years. Across Asia, it’s common for the same area to be trawled 3 to 10 times per year. This has been confirmed by some smaller scientific surveys in the region. Scientific surveys have periodically monitored stocks in the Gulf of Thailand for decades. They show a large reduction in fish stocks over time. Other surveys of trawling efforts across the region show similar declines. Ask local experts about the state of fish stocks, and most have a similar take: they are in poor condition.14 Of course, it won’t apply to all fisheries across these regions. Some will be well-managed and healthy. But, based on what we know (and especially the fact that we don’t know a lot), the consensus is that many of these fish stocks are not in a healthy place. Let’s then turn to the health of fish across the regions for which we do have good assessments. It so happens that these tend to be richer countries: those across Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan. This database covers over 1,200 of these fish stocks, over half of the world’s fish catch. In the chart, we see how these stocks are doing. It shows the biomass of fish populations. That is, essentially, the amount of wild fish there. It’s the number of fish multiplied by their mass. Here, we’re measuring these stocks relative to the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. The maximum sustainable yield is the sweet spot where we can catch as many fish as possible without reducing the fish population below the most productive level. A value of one is the ‘optimal’. We’re maximizing fish catch while keeping populations stable. A value greater than one is good for fish populations (there are more fish) but not good for humans since we’re missing out on fish catch. A value below one is not good: fish stocks are lower than we’d like, and while we might catch more fish in the short term, we will miss out in the longer term. You can add more regions using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Fish stocks are healthy across most of these regions. Australia, Alaska, the US Northeast and Southeast Coasts, Japan, and Europe Atlantic are all above one another, hovering around this optimal value. However, there are a few regions that are not doing so well. The Canadian East Coast has seen a large decline in recent years. Assessed stocks in South America and Africa are struggling. The European Mediterranean is not doing well. This is reflected in the fact that the Black Sea is very overfished. Whether a fish stock is doing well or not is mainly determined by its fishing intensity: what fraction of the population is being caught each year. Fish too much, and the population can’t be maintained. In this chart, we see levels of fishing intensity across the same regions. Again, this is measured relative to the intensity at the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. An optimal value is one. If the intensity is greater than one, then we’re overfishing. Fish stocks tend to be a lagging indicator of fishing intensity. So, if we hold fishing intensity too high (above one) – even if only slightly – then stocks will inevitably fall below one until fishing pressures are reduced. The status of stocks across different regions might tell us where we might find healthy stocks – and, as a result, where we might want to source our fish from – but they’re averaged across many types of fish. It doesn’t tell us about what fish we might want to buy or avoid. How are stocks of tuna, cod, mackerel, or sharks holding up? In the chart, we see the same metric as before – fish stocks measured by biomass – across different types. Across most of the main fish groups – tunas, shrimp, cod, and perch – stocks are at or above ‘one’ – the sweet spot where we catch as many fish as possible while keeping populations stable. That’s good news. Many of our most popular stocks are well-managed and have healthy populations. A few groups are not faring so well. In recent years, mackerel have dropped below the optimal level due to increased fishing intensity. And sharks are declining rapidly – a worrying trend. Let’s look at a few of these species in more detail: tuna, which is doing surprisingly well, and sharks, which are not. The health of tuna populations has been a concern for decades. We often hear that tuna are being overfished to extinction. That we should avoid them if we want to eat sustainably. But many tuna populations are now well-managed. Previously, we looked at the aggregate of tuna stocks; we can zoom in further and look at particular regional stocks. In the chart, we see the health of fish stocks across three oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Tunas in the Atlantic and Pacific are managed close to their ‘maximum sustainable yield’. That’s positive news. The trend looks worse for those in the Indian Ocean. Its stocks have now fallen below one and look to be continuing downwards. Atlantic and Pacific tuna might be a reasonable fish choice. Tuna from the Indian Ocean has less of a guarantee of being from a sustainable source. However, we can go even further and look at specific tuna species, such as bluefin or yellowfin. We see these stocks in the chart. Some tuna stocks have recovered through improved management – especially in the US and European waters. From the chart, we see that many are above one: the maximum sustainable yield. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. Many of the tuna stocks that were the biggest concern have started to turn things around. We see this in this chart, which now shows fish stocks measured as their total mass in tonnes rather than relative to the maximum sustainable yield. Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, we see a massive decline in tuna populations. The Southern bluefin tuna by more than 90% – from over 8.5 million tonnes to less than one million. The Western Pacific yellowfin fell by three-quarters. However, since the millennium, better management of fisheries and reduced overfishing have resulted in many of these stocks showing some signs of recovery. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. While many of the world’s tuna stocks might be starting to recover, shark populations are declining. We previously saw that shark stocks were being overexploited and populations were declining. We see this again in the chart here. What’s even more concerning is that this only tells us about assessed shark populations. Many more stocks have not been assessed – and these are likely to be in regions where monitoring is poor and illegal catch is poorly regulated. There, shark populations might be in even poorer health. In general, sharks and rays tend to grow and reproduce more slowly than other fished species, meaning that it takes longer for individuals who have been caught to be replaced. This contributes to their increased extinction risk, reflected in the IUCN Red List. A third of the world's sharks and rays have been assessed as being threatened with extinction15. However, this slow rate of growth and reproduction is not true of all shark and ray species, and some species can support sustainable fisheries 16. In our Fish Stocks Data Explorer, we present the key metrics for assessed fish stocks from the RAM Legacy Database.17 This provides a high-resolution breakdown of specific fish stocks across the world. For general readers, this might be too detailed. However, it could be useful for those with a background in this area to explore specific fish stocks. One of the best ways to reduce our impact on the environment is by changing what we eat. The research shows us that we can have the biggest impact by eating less meat and dairy. Or substituting lower-impact meats such as chicken and pork for beef and lamb. But I’m often asked the question: “What about fish and seafood? Is that an environmentally-friendly option?”. There are lots of types of seafood: not only different species but also ways of producing them. We can catch them in the wild or grow them in fish farms. But in most comparisons of food products, they’re aggregated into one or two categories, such as “marine fish” or “freshwater fish”. This doesn’t really inform us about what type of fish to eat. Let’s take a closer look at the impacts of specific types of seafood. ‘Environmental impact’ can mean very different things: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use or chemical pollution. It’s useful to look at all of these impacts in case there are large trade-offs between them. In a new study published in Nature, Jessica Gephart and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of the impacts of fish and seafood across multiple environmental metrics.18 To do this, they combined life-cycle analysis data from studies of wild-caught and farmed seafood products. It covered over 1690 fish farms and 1000 records from fisheries. These results look at the impacts on-farm and off-farm, up to the farmgate. That means up to the point that harvested or caught fish are brought back to land. It includes all of the inputs into production, such as fish feed or fuel use in fisheries. It does not include post-farm processes such as transport to retail, packaging, or cooking.19 Here, we’re looking at five key metrics: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, freshwater use, and nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This doesn’t include the sustainability of wild fish stocks, which is obviously another important metric that we need to consider. We looked at what’s happening to global fish stocks earlier on this page. The impacts across the seafood products are shown in the charts. Here, we’re looking at the median across all of the assessed studies.20 These impacts are shown per kilogram of edible weight. That means we’re not including inedible parts such as shells or bones. Comparing fish to other types of fish is useful. But we also want to know how seafood compares to other protein foods. So, we’ve included chicken for comparison.21 Chicken tends to have the lowest environmental impact of meat and dairy products – much less than beef and lamb and a bit better than pork. So when we make this comparison, we’re really seeing how seafood compares to animal protein with the lowest impact. Overall, we see that a lot of seafood has a relatively low environmental impact compared to animal protein sources. Many types have a lower carbon footprint than chicken (those that are higher are around 20-30% higher). Most farmed seafood needs less land and freshwater and causes less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This is because fish tend to be more efficient than chickens in converting feed into meat, which means they need less feed per kilogram. There are some exceptions, though: wild flounder, lobster, and shrimp, for example, can have a high carbon footprint. More than double that of chicken. Related chart: Looking at the median footprints allows us to make quick, general assessments of the high- and lowest-impact species. However, they can hide the variability among a given species based on where and how it’s produced. This makes little difference for some species, but for others, it can have a large impact. In the chart, we see the spread of greenhouse gas emissions among the different types of seafood. The median of each – as we looked at above – is shown as the thick black line for each bar. The width of the bar shows us how variable this can be: it tells us what the largest and smallest impact can be for each species. Wild-caught seafood is shown in blue; farmed seafood is in red. Now we see that not only are there large differences in the median between each. There are also large differences in how variable emissions can be. In general, we tend to see that the impacts of farmed seafood are much less variable than wild-caught; the red bars are much thinner than the blue. Let’s take salmon as an example. The median emissions for farmed and wild-caught salmon are similar; farmed has a slightly lower footprint of 5.1 versus 6.9 kg CO2e per kg. But the big difference comes from the spread of emissions: wild-caught can range anywhere from 1.7 to 17 kg CO2e. That’s a ten-fold difference. Farmed salmon only ranges from 4.1 to 6.2 kg CO2e, a 50% difference between the minimum and maximum. If you choose wild-caught salmon, you could be picking a low-carbon or a high-carbon protein source. It might even be lower than farmed salmon. But if you pick farmed salmon, you are almost guaranteed that it will be relatively low-carbon. We see this across other species, too: see shrimp, for example. The same is true in our comparison to chicken. Chickens have a very low footprint variation. Wild-caught fish such as salmon or tuna can have a lower or higher footprint depending on where and how it’s caught. Some choices that will guarantee a relatively low footprint are farmed bivalves (mussels, oysters, and scallops) and seaweed – these are filter-feeding organisms that also sequester carbon and nutrients in their shells. That is partly why they have such low emissions, and they need no additional land either. Farmed salmon, trout, carp, and catfish are also good choices. What do these results tell us about how seafood fits into a sustainable diet? Again, we should be clear that the most effective way to reduce the impact of your diet is to eat less animal-sourced products overall. On the basis of total protein and calories, plant-based foods such as legumes and soy still have a much lower impact. However, for those who do not want to eliminate animal products completely, seafood can be a good choice. Many types of seafood have a lower impact than chicken. This means they have a much lower impact than foods such as beef or lamb. As we saw earlier on this page, the status of wild fish stocks is mixed. Effective management of fisheries across Europe and North America means that many of these fish stocks are stable and no longer in decline.11 Unfortunately, we know much less about the health of fish stocks across Asia and much of Africa, but many of these stocks are likely to be overfished. That matters for where you source wild-caught fish; sourcing from European or American fisheries might be a safer choice if you want to ensure they are sustainable. The issue of wild fish stock depletion is not an issue for farmed seafood. As these fish tend to also have a low carbon and land footprint, farmed fish can be a low-impact source of protein. Most of the fishing methods we use have some kind of environmental impact – whether it’s burning fuel in fishing boats, unintentionally catching fish or marine animals we don’t want (bycatch), or leaving behind remnants of fishing gear. But dredging – sometimes referred to as bottom trawling – has the largest negative impact. Bottom trawling drags a structure along the seabed – at various depths in the sediment, depending on the specific method – to dislodge organisms such as crustaceans. It’s an incredibly efficient way to catch seafood. That’s why it’s so common: one-quarter of the world’s fish are caught this way. But it usually comes at an environmental cost. In this section, we look at how much of the seafloor is trawled, what the consequences are, and what we can do to reduce its impacts. Let’s first look at the question of how much of the seafloor is affected by trawling. Improved satellite and GPS tracking technologies mean that scientists can now map trawling patterns at high resolution. In a paper published in Nature, Enric Sala and colleagues estimate that around 5 million square kilometers (km2) of seabed is trawled each year.22 In the chart below, I’ve put this into the context of the global seabed area as a whole. The total ocean seabed spans 361 million km2.23 That’s the top bar in the chart. Most of this is deep ocean, far from the world’s continents, and at depths that we rarely visit. Around 10% of the world’s seabed is shallower than 1000 meters – this threshold includes all of the world’s continental shelves and areas that we’d fish in. That means 37 million km2 of seabed is within our scope. That is shown by the second bar. Our 5 million km2 of trawled seabed – shown as the bottom bar – is therefore equal to around 13.5% of the explorable seabed. In the context of the total seabed area, it’s 1.4%. Many have compared this area to the Amazon Rainforest.24 To some extent, the areas do match: the Amazon rainforest spans approximately 5 million km2. But we should be careful about using this comparison. Trawling does not have the same impact as cutting down a primary rainforest. As we will soon see, trawling does kill a lot of life on the seabed, but recovery times can be very quick: in the order of a few months to years. When we cut down the primary rainforest, we lock ourselves into a recovery period of many decades. Maybe even longer. What’s also important to note is that the same areas are often trawled again and again.25 What this means is that it’s not a different 5 million km2 that’s trawled every year. If that were true, within five years, almost all of the shallow seabed would be trawled. Thankfully, that’s not the case. The extent of trawling varies a lot from region to region. In a study published in PNAS, Ricardo Amoroso and colleagues mapped the extent of trawling across different regions.26 They monitored the share of continental shelves – to a depth of 1000m – that was trawled at least once during a period of two to four years.27 Some regions – such as South Chile, Alaska, and the Australian shelves – experienced almost no trawling at all. Others experienced a lot. 80% of the continental shelf in the Adriatic Sea was trawled. 42% of the North Sea was trawled. One-quarter of the shelf in the Irish Sea was. You can see these rates by region here. Passing a trawl over the seabed can have quite a severe impact on the organisms that live there. How much of the biota is affected depends on a couple of factors, including the type of gear used, the type of sediment, and what lifeforms live there. We might imagine that a coral that sticks out from the seabed will be destroyed while organisms deeper in the sediment might survive. Researchers have carried out studies to see what impact trawling has on wildlife – either through experimental methods or observing real-world impacts. In an analysis published in PNAS, Jan Geert Hiddink and colleagues brought these experiments together to build a complete picture.28 The impact of trawling really depends on the type of method and gear that’s used. We see that in the chart below, which shows the impact of four types: otter trawling, beam trawling, towed dregs, and hydraulic dredging. On the y-axis, we have the share of organisms that are removed or killed by a single pass of a trawl over the seabed. On the x-axis, we have the depth of the ocean sediment that the trawl reaches. What we see clearly is that the deeper the trawl digs into the sediment, the more biota we kill. Otter trawls have the lowest impact: they dig just 2.4 centimeters into the sediment, and around 6% of organisms are lost. Beam trawls lose 14%. Towed dredges dig twice as deep, and one-fifth of organisms are killed off. The most damaging method is hydraulic dredging: it digs deep into the sediment at 16 centimeters, and 41% of organisms are destroyed as a result. Once this area has been affected by trawling, how long does it take for its biodiversity to recover? For the ecosystem to get back to its pre-trawling state takes a few years if it’s left alone. In their analysis, Hiddink and colleagues found average recovery times (where ‘recovery’ means getting back to 95% of pre-trawling biomass levels) in the range of 1.9 to 6.4 years. The differences here were dependent on the method used – the shallower otter trawls caused less damage and recovered more quickly than the deep hydraulic trawling – and the environmental context, such as the type of seabed. This finding was consistent with previous studies, finding recovery to be in the range of years [this study, for example, reports a 4-5 year recovery time across multiple commercial trawling sites].29 Several years might seem like a long time, but it’s actually pretty fast for an ecosystem to recover. This is why I don’t find the comparison between dredging and rainforest clearing to be a particularly helpful one. If we cut down the Amazon rainforest, it will be decades, if not centuries, before it gets back to its previous state. Thankfully, these seabed communities recover orders of magnitude more quickly. But, of course, they only recover if we leave them alone. How is bottom trawling changing across the world? Is it becoming more or less common? Globally, bottom trawling rapidly increased through the second half of the 20th century. But it has not changed much since the 1990s. We see this in the chart. What has changed is where bottom trawling is happening. Trawling rates were very high across Europe in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. However, growing concern about the depletion of wild fish stocks has led to a significant reduction in recent decades to allow populations to recover. The cases of the UK, Portugal, and Spain are shown in the chart. Portuguese catch from bottom trawling has fallen by 90% since the 1960s.30 In 2016, the European Commission also banned bottom trawling in deeper water below 800 meters. We see the same in Japan, where the catch peaked in 1972 at 4 million tonnes and has since fallen by around 90% to 400,000 tonnes. Bottom trawling has been growing elsewhere, though. It has been growing rapidly in China and India since the 1980s. Although these rates have stabilized – or even declined – in the last few years. Since most methods of trawling create environmental damage, you might suggest that the best option is to eliminate it completely. But in reality, it is still the most efficient method of catching seafood – which is why so many countries continue to use it. We can limit the use of trawling, which, in fact, many countries have. We just saw examples of this across Europe and Japan. But this will come at the cost of catch and income for communities that rely on it. If we can’t – or don’t want to – eliminate it completely, there are still things we can do to limit its impacts. The types of gear used for trawling can have very different impacts. Some are much more damaging than others. One option is, therefore, to ban specific types of gear rather than completely ban the practice. Another option is to modify the types of gear used to limit their damage to the seabed. For example, the doors on otter trawls are very destructive; newer designs now limit the amount of impact these doors have on the seafloor. In some cases, they eliminate this contact completely. Finally, we can ban trawling in specific locations where the habitat is particularly sensitive. For example, not allowing trawling in areas with coral reefs or important biodiverse habitats such as seagrasses. This would allow trawling activity to continue but would protect important areas of our ocean at the same time. Fish farming – also known as aquaculture – has boomed over the last 50 years. Production has increased more than 50-fold. In fact, we now produce more seafood from aquaculture than we do from wild catch. This has been good news for the health of global fish stocks. Global demand for seafood might have increased, but wild fish populations are finite. If we push beyond the limits of how quickly fish populations recover, this becomes unsustainable. Aquaculture has, therefore, been an ingenious solution: rather than relying on wild fish, we can produce our own. Nearly all of the growth in seafood production in recent decades has come from aquaculture; wild fish catch has changed very little. However, there has been one concern about the rise of aquaculture in relation to wild fish stocks. Like any type of animal farming, we need to feed them. Sometimes, we feed them fishmeal and fish oils. Not all aquaculture species are fed from animal sources, but many are. They don’t necessarily need fishmeal and oils in their diets, but fish farmers often use them because they provide an almost perfect balance of essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids. Many have questioned whether aquaculture is really the solution that it seems. If it is partly fed by wild fish, perhaps more fish farms means more pressure on wild fish stocks? Here, I take us through the numbers to understand how much wild fish catch really goes towards animal feed, how this is changing over time, and whether this undermines the benefits of aquaculture. Let’s first understand the amount of wild fish that is used as feed. In the chart, we see the breakdown of global fish catch in 2017.31 The world caught around 109 million tonnes of fish. 84% of this was used for direct human consumption. The remaining 16% was turned into fishmeal and oils to use as animal feed. 5% went to land-based livestock such as cows, pigs, and chickens. 11% went to aquaculture as feed for farmed fish. This bottom component is what we’re most interested in. In the second bar, we see global aquaculture production. We produce around 112 million tonnes of farmed seafood a year. We should be careful not to interpret this as the total input and output of feed for fish farming. It’s not the case that we put 12.6 million tonnes of feed in and magically get 112 million tonnes of fish back. That would massively overstate the efficiency of fish farms. First, fishmeal is just one of many things that we need to fish, so there are other inputs. Second, many aquaculture species are not fed fishmeal or oils at all. Only a small share of fish catch is used as feed for aquaculture today. However, aquaculture production has grown quickly. If we want to understand how sustainable this is, we need to know how the use of fish for feed has changed over time. In the chart, we see global fish catch since 1950.32  It is broken down by whether it is used for direct human consumption, animal feed, or other uses (which are mainly industrial uses of oils). First, we see that global fish catch has been relatively stable since 1990. If aquaculture was putting pressure on fish production, it’s not obvious from the total catch. When we look at the breakdown, we also see that the amount allocated to fishmeal and oil (animal feed) has not changed much since 1990. It increased a lot from the 1950s through to the 1980s. But since 1990, it has actually declined. This decline is seen even more clearly in this chart, which shows the amount of wild fish used as animal feed (in blue) and aquaculture production (in red).33 As we will see later, in its infancy, the aquaculture industry was inefficient. To produce one fish, you need several fish as feed inputs. That’s part of the explanation for why feed inputs in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s were higher than aquaculture production. Thankfully, aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has declined over the last few decades. This is for several reasons. First, the feed conversion and efficiency of fish farms have improved. Second, we’ve been discovering blends of plant-based ingredients that offer all of the essential nutrients; this reduces the need for fishmeal and oil. As we can see from the chart, aquaculture production increased by 250% between 2000 and 2015. Meanwhile, fish caught for feed actually declined. Aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has been weakening. It’s not the case that more and more aquaculture puts more and more pressure on wild fish. There’s one key metric that we need to understand: the efficiency of fish feed and the FIFO ratio. The Fish In: Fish Out (FIFO) ratio tells us how much fish we need to feed aquaculture species to get one fish back in return. If you have a FIFO greater than 1, you need more fish inputs than you get back from your fish farm. So a ratio of 2 means you need two fish equivalents of fishmeal and oil to be able to produce one fish in return. On the flip side, a ratio of 0.5 means you get two fish back from every fish you put in. In the chart here, we see the FIFO ratio across all of the most common aquaculture species.34 At the bottom, we see the total across all species fed by fishmeal. This shows the change in FIFO in the two decades from 1997 (the red markers) to 2017 (blue markers). In 1997, aquaculture used fish feed very inefficiently. The overall ratio was 1.9, meaning almost two fish were required as inputs to produce one fish in return. This has improved massively in the decades since then. In 2017, this ratio was 0.28: we got three fish back from one fish used as input.35 This improvement came from efficiency gains, as well as a switch to other plant-based feed blends. The FIFO improved for all aquaculture species. Today, this ratio for the most common species – carp, tilapia, and catfishes, shown at the top – is incredibly low. They use very tiny amounts of fishmeal as inputs. On the other hand, farmed salmon, trout, and eel still have unfavorable ratios. This has improved significantly in recent decades but is still well above 1. Hopefully, this ratio will continue to fall. Overall, aquaculture is an important solution to meet the growing demand for seafood. We cannot take endless numbers of wild fish from our oceans, so if we want more fish, we’re going to have to produce our own. A few decades ago, aquaculture’s benefits were questionable. But with massive improvements in efficiency, it is now a net producer of seafood. Fears that a growing aquaculture industry would put more and more pressure on wild fish stocks have not come true. When fishers go out to catch fish, it would be great if they only caught the fish that they need. If they’re fishing for tuna, they catch their daily quota of tuna and leave the rest of the ecosystem undisturbed. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Fishers also catch marine life that they don’t want. Catch that is not the species we’re targeting is called by-catch. Fishers sometimes bring by-catch back to land to eat or sell. But often, they will throw these unwanted fish back into the water. The animals they throw back are called discards. Discards can be dead or alive, but the survival rate is low. Some hardy shellfish might survive, but most discarded fish are dead. There are various reasons why fishers might not want these fish. They might be too small, inedible, damaged, or not give them a good return in the market. Fishers might also have strict quota restrictions on how much they can bring back each day. If they’re over the limit, they will have to throw some fish back. Discards are obviously negative. First, there is the obvious ethical lens of animal welfare – not only are we killing animals, but we’re killing them without an end use or purpose. Killing for no reason. Second, this is an issue that is often hidden from official statistics. Only ‘landings’ – the fish brought back to land – are recorded in most databases, such as those of the UN fisheries. Discards are not reported. It’s hard to understand fish stocks if large numbers of fish kills are going unmonitored. Maintaining sustainable fish stocks relies on us understanding how quickly fish populations regenerate and balancing this with how much fish we catch. Hidden catches could tip this out-of-balance. Thankfully, we are not completely blind. Marine scientists do reconstruct and estimate discards. The UN Fisheries Division also carries out periodic – around once every decade  – assessments to understand the magnitude of the problem. Globally, we throw less than a tenth of the fish and marine animals we catch back into the ocean. We see this in the chart, which shows global fish catch since 1950. This is split into ‘landings’ – catch that is brought back to land – and ‘discards’, the catch that is thrown back into the ocean. Researchers Dirk Zeller, Daniel Pauly, and Maria Palomares can reconstruct this data from estimates of how many discards are captured from different fishing methods.36 For example, the percentage of catch from bottom trawls that ends up being discarded. Their web platform – Sea Around Us – is an excellent resource for understanding global fisheries. The chart shows that the majority of the aquatic animals are brought ashore and used for human or animal consumption. The remaining amount is thrown back into the water. The UN Fisheries Division did an independent assessment of discards and found a similar result.37 It estimated that annual discards (averaged from 2010 to 2014) were around 9.1 million tonnes. That was 10.8% of the total catch. The amount of fish we discard has declined a lot in recent decades. We see this in the other chart, which shows plots that have been discarded since 1950. In the early 1950s, we were throwing around 5 million tonnes of fish away. This increased to 14 million tonnes in 1989. Since then, discards have fallen to around 8 or 9 million tonnes. This is back to levels in the late 1950s. Some fishing methods generate much more discards than others. You’re not going to generate the same unwanted catch using a fishing rod as you are from bottom trawling – dragging a large net along the seafloor. If you’re doing the latter, you’re going to end up with lots of unwanted animals in your net. It’s difficult to discriminate for the particular species that you want. Researchers gather data on how much catch is discarded when different types of fishing gear are used. This gives us what is called the discard rate – what percentage of the total catch is thrown back into the water. The average results across different fishing methods are shown in the chart. Unsurprisingly, trawling has the highest discard rate; half of the catch from shrimp trawls is thrown back in. The fact that trawling tends to have a high discard rate, and it is the method used to catch a lot of our fish, means that around half of global fish discards come from bottom trawling. There are no big winners when it comes to discards. Fish are killed needlessly, and the fact that these fish are not sold or eaten means that no one benefits from more income or food. Reducing discards is a good thing. As we saw earlier, discards have fallen since the 1990s. Why have they declined,  and can we learn to replicate it? One factor has been a rising market value of fish – even the species that fishers do not intend to catch. Fishers are, therefore, incentivized to bring more of their bycatch to land and sell it. That means that even if bycatch did not decline, the amount of discards would. Some countries have implemented a no-discard policy – a ban on discards at sea.37 This is sometimes called a ‘landing obligation’, which means that fishers must keep all of their caught fish on board and bring them back to land to declare as ‘landings’. This policy was implemented by the European Union and was a core part of its Common Fisheries Policy reform in 2013. If fishers have a quota or limit on how much fish they can catch, they have to be much more careful about by-catch – these unwanted fish will still count towards their quota for the day. Improved gear has led to much more selective fishing practices. Over time, gear has been adapted to reduce by-catch. Examples of this include changes in the size and shape of mesh and hook, adding ‘escape panels’ to trap nets, or the use of underwater lights or acoustic alarms.38 This has been shown to be effective in multiple contexts.39 Some countries – Belize is one example – go as far as to ban non-selective fishing gear completely.40 Many of the effective solutions to reduce discards rely on effective monitoring and enforcement of fishery policies. This means that countries that have been successful so far tend to be those with strong fisheries policies. Others lag behind, but there’s no reason to think that they could not do the same. Eliminating by-catch completely might be unrealistic. But the fact that discards have been falling means that we can do something about it. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are areas of ocean – which includes the water column and seafloor – that have been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment. Regulations in marine protected areas can vary but include interventions such as no fishing zones, restrictions on fishing such as the type of gear that can be used, bans or restrictions on activities such as mining, and regulations on inputs to the ocean from rivers and industrial effluents. How much of the world’s ocean is protected today? Here, we have to differentiate between national territorial waters – that is, parts of the ocean typically closer to coastlines that countries have national rights over – and international waters (also called the ‘high seas’) that do not belong to any single country. In the chart, we see the amount in each zone that is protected and unprotected.41 As of 2021, 7.7% of the total ocean is protected. This means 92% is unprotected. We see that much more of the world’s national waters are protected than international ones. In the charts here, we see the share of territorial waters that are protected in each country. This does not include international waters (‘high seas’). Schijns, R., Froese, R., Hutchings, J. A., Pauly, D., & Raicevich, S. (2021).

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,The Tuna Transparency Pledge," Tackling IUU fishing together by increasing #EyesOnTuna 
   On April 10, 2024, The Nature Conservancy launched the Tuna Transparency Pledge, a global initiative aiming to unite actors throughout the tuna supply chain to achieve 100% on-the-water monitoring on all industrial tuna vessels by 2027. The initial signatories of the Tuna Transparency Pledge span the entire supply chain and include Walmart, Albertsons Companies and Thai Union, along with the governments of Belize and the Federated States of Micronesia. The Nature Conservancy is seeking sign-ons from other retailers, seafood supply chain organizations and governments to address unsustainable and illegal tuna fishing practices and help drive industry-wide transformation. For more information, please contact tunapledge@tnc.org.  
 
        That's equivalent to 40% of the global population. Yet two-thirds of global fisheries are either overfished or cannot sustain further pressure.
        
     
 
        Each year, tuna fisheries produce 5 million tons of fish, with a dockside value of $10 billion USD. But a lack of transparency is threatening global seafood supply, harming coastal communities, and undermining marine conservation efforts. 
        
     
 
        To protect this valuable supply chain, including the fishers, coastal communities and businesses who rely on it, retailers, seafood suppliers, and governments across the world are joining the Tuna Transparency Pledge.
        
       A lack of visibility in the tuna supply chain is threatening global seafood supply, harming coastal communities, and undermining marine conservation efforts. The vast majority of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing takes place on legally licensed vessels, through prohibited activities such as misreporting of retained catch, shark finning and catching endangered species.   Without transparency at sea, retailers and seafood suppliers face the serious risk of stocking illegally and unsustainably sourced tuna products, compromising the longevity of supply chains, brand reputation and consumer trust. Simply put—without accurate data on fishing activity, we cannot responsibly and effectively manage tuna fisheries and put a stop to illegal fishing.  From fishery to fishery, one challenge continues to surface: Insufficient science and compliance data are holding back industry efforts to increase transparency. Monitoring—whether carried out by human or electronic observers— gives us the opportunity to have sight of what’s happening on fishing vessels, allowing fishery managers and companies to make great strides in eliminating IUU fishing at the source.  Uses on-board cameras and GPS and gear sensors to capture and record fishing activity, such as catch size, fish health, and fishing locations.   Independent specialists who monitor industrial fishing activity and collect data, such as logging the daily fish catch, measuring samples of fish and recording bycatch and any associated violations. Reliable and accurate information from on-the-water monitoring benefits every step in the supply chain, ensuring tuna supplies for future generations, verifying compliance with fishing regulations, and delivering the standards consumers expect from the industry.   On-the-water monitoring is the best way to guarantee seafood products were harvested in compliance with fishery laws.    The Tuna Transparency Pledge aims to achieve 100% on-the-water monitoring (through electronic monitoring and/or human observers) on all industrial tuna fishing vessels by 2027. With a vision of a thriving global marine environment that provides stable and sustainable supplies of seafood, the initiative guides and unites companies and governments, helping lay the foundation for a more resilient and transparent tuna supply chain that allows people and the planet to thrive.  Retailers, seafood suppliers, and fishery managers are in a powerful position to influence and improve the tuna supply chain.     Together we aim to achieve 100% on-the-water monitoring for all industrial tuna fishing vessels by 2027—taking a bold and achievable step in transforming the health and sustainability of our ocean.  On-the-water monitoring helps ensure that the seafood on shelves has been harvested in compliance with fishery laws, while also providing critical data needed for the sustainable management of tuna and other wildlife.  The pledge protects the long-term viability of fisheries, valuable supply chains and coastal communities.     The Tuna Transparency Pledge is an initiative led by The Nature Conservancy with support from a variety of NGO and industry collaborators. 
          A multi-billion dollar seafood company is working with conservationists to increase tuna transparency—two of their leaders share why. 
         
 
          Pacific Island Tuna, a partnership between The Nature Conservancy and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, will soon begin supplying Walmart’s store brand canned tuna.

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Google,Catch Me If You Can: The Global Pursuit of a Fugitive Ship," This article is also available in audio format. Listen now, download, or subscribe to “Hakai Magazine Audio Edition” through your favorite podcast app. In the middle of the Indian Ocean in March 2018, a rusty fishing boat cut through the waves as a similarly sized but far-sleeker vessel called the Ocean Warrior followed in hot pursuit. At 54 meters long and nine meters wide, the Ocean Warrior is equipped with four engines, long-range fuel tanks, a helicopter landing pad, and a water cannon capable of hosing its target with about 20,000 liters each minute. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society had custom built the US $8-million vessel for running down Japanese whaling ships in the Southern Ocean, but had recently been using it to patrol the waters off Tanzania for illegal fishing boats in partnership with the Tanzanian government and a task force representing eight East African countries called FISH-i Africa. Sea Shepherd provided the boat, crew, and fuel; FISH-i Africa, offered advice borne of experience counteracting illegal fishing operations; and Tanzania provided law enforcement agents who had the authority to apprehend vessels. The 20-day patrol was supposed to be local, but on the third day, the ship’s team had received a call from a contact in Tanzania: a notorious illegal fishing vessel, the STS-50, had escaped from port in Maputo, Mozambique, where authorities were supposed to be guarding it. Was there anything the Ocean Warrior could do to help? The team agreed to give chase. The STS-50 was a 452-tonne, 1980s-era former longliner originally from Japan. It was well known in maritime circles under its previous names—the Andrey Dolgov, the Sea Breeze, the Ayda—for poaching Antarctic and Patagonian toothfish (also called Chilean sea bass), two lucrative cod species from the Southern Ocean. Authorities believe the STS-50 operated illegally for 10 years or so and looted up to $50-million worth of the fish, which can grow to 120 kilograms and live for 60 years. Interpol had issued a purple notice for the vessel—an international request for information about the STS-50’s criminal activity. But the vessel’s owners and captain had been evading authorities for years with a typical bag of tricks: registering the boat to nations with lax rules; using shell companies to obscure ownership; forging documents; and spoofing the most advanced satellite surveillance. The STS-50’s captain was also a master of escape; the getaway from Maputo was the third time he had given port authorities the slip. This time, the Ocean Warrior crew was determined to keep their eyes on the target. But, after chasing the STS-50 for more than 1,600 kilometers across the Indian Ocean, the Ocean Warrior was low on fuel. The predicament forced the Sea Shepherd captain, Mike Dicks, to make an agonizing decision: turn back. It looked like the STS-50 was about to disappear yet again. Mike Dicks of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and his crew trail the STS-50 after it flees from Mozambique. Photo courtesy of Sea Shepherd Instead, something else happened. On April 6, 2018, less than two weeks after the Ocean Warrior abandoned chase, Indonesian authorities captured the STS-50 near Banda Aceh. It was a rare victory against an illegal fishing boat, and it highlighted a growing international movement to tackle fishing crimes. In Latin, the high seas are maria libera—meaning “free seas”—a term that helps explain why criminals see these parts of the ocean as easy places to get rich. Historically, illegal fishing has been nearly impossible to counteract, especially on the high seas, which begin where national jurisdiction ends—370 kilometers from a nation’s shore—and cover two-thirds of the world’s oceans. A loose patchwork of laws and international treaties govern these parts of the oceans, but in most places, they’re rarely enforced, allowing illegal fishing and a plethora of related crimes to go unpunished. Vessels that fish illegally are often involved in human trafficking and drug smuggling while contributing to plummeting fish stocks and degraded marine ecosystems. Experts estimate that up to 20 percent of the world’s total catch (fish and other marine fauna) falls under illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. That’s more than 23 million tonnes of seafood stolen from the seas annually—or one out of every five wild-caught fish sold on the market—worth $23.5-billion. Just six years ago, the STS-50 probably would have gotten away, says Per Erik Bergh, the secretary of Stop Illegal Fishing, an Africa-based nonprofit. But around that time, international authorities and nonprofits began working together more closely to take down illegal vessels. As the players gained one another’s trust, a powerful weapon in the fight against illegal fishing emerged. Ending the STS-50’s reign of pillage had taken countless hours of work by dozens of collaborators across 40 nations: fishers, port authorities, government officials, and representatives from existing coalitions designed to combat marine crime. For Peter Hammarstedt, the director of ship operations for Sea Shepherd who helped coordinate the Ocean Warrior’s pursuit from land, the effort to capture the STS-50 was a testament to the global nature of fisheries crime—and the global solutions required to stop it. “It was exciting,” Hammarstedt says, “to know that all these countries were working together to make sure this one vessel would not get away.” There were major challenges and a bit of luck, Bergh says, but in the end, “it all worked and you just don’t often see that.” The demise of the STS-50 served as proof that the collaborative enforcement model was making progress. In February 2018, about a month and a half before the STS-50’s capture, Antoine Jeulain was sitting alone in his office in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar, when he received disturbing news. At the time, he was the French liaison officer at the Madagascar-based Regional Maritime Information Fusion Center, a new information sharing initiative for combatting illegal fishing in the western Indian Ocean. A vessel called the STS-50 had arrived at Fort Dauphin (also known as Tolagnaro), a port on the island’s southeast coast. The boat was evidently registered to Togo, a small West African country, and had come to port because of mechanical issues. An inspector with the Madagascar fisheries control agency had boarded the STS-50 and found suspicious documentation. He took a picture and sent it to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), an intergovernmental organization that manages tuna in the region. The IOTC confirmed that the document was forged. When Jeulain heard the news through his network, he began making inquiries of his own. From Interpol, he learned that the STS-50 was wanted by seven nations for illegal fishing. Jeulain then checked to see if the vessel’s certification was valid. An official from Togo sent him the response: “We wish to inform you that it’s fraud.” But by the time Jeulain received the email, the STS-50 had left Fort Dauphin. He relayed pictures and the STS-50’s last known positions to his networks in African ports, hoping they would be ready when the rusty ship re-emerged. At that point, the STS-50 might have remained just another one of the numerous illegal fishing vessels that have eluded capture for years. An estimated 168 IUU fishing vessels operate on oceans around the world. The STS-50 went by several different names over the years. It started out in Japan in 1985 as the Shinsei Maru No. 2. Photo courtesy of Sea Shepherd Illegal fishing has confounded fisheries managers for years, says Christian Bueger, an expert in maritime security and a professor of international relations at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Coastal nations have typically viewed the issue mainly as an environmental management problem instead of as organized crime. But in many parts of the world, illegal fishing has become a clear threat to coastal security. In Somalia, for example, some locals who have taken to piracy claim it’s a way of guarding their waters against foreign poachers. As the impacts of illegal fishing ripple out, countries are taking the problem more seriously. To address mounting fisheries crimes, Interpol, with support from Norway and a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts, launched Project Scale in 2013. Nonprofits such as Sea Shepherd and FISH-i Africa, which is associated with Stop Illegal Fishing, and fusion centers such as the one Jeulain was helping build (themselves cooperative entities representing multiple nations) joined the effort. A key part of the project’s work is determining which vessels pose a high risk of carrying out illegal activity based on past behavior and then sharing that information among port authorities, coast guards, and fisheries inspectors around the world. The partners look for boats that have forged paperwork, frequently changed their names and countries of registration, or been involved with illegal fishing in the past. The expertise they honed proved invaluable when the Project Scale players joined the hunt for the STS-50. The Southern Ocean comprises a swath of sea encircling Antarctica and makes up roughly 15 percent of the world’s ocean area. Though often thought of as too inhospitable for human activity, the region is hardly an untouched wilderness. Seven countries lay territorial claim to slices of the region and the resources it contains. In the late 1700s, people first hunted Antarctic fur seals, driving them close to extinction by 1825. They moved on to elephant seals and some species of penguins for their oil. Whaling began soon after, and then krill fishing began in the late 1970s. In response to the growing commercial interest in the region, a group of 26 countries got together and formed the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), established by international convention in 1982 with the goal of protecting Antarctic marine life. CCAMLR sets the fishing quotas for the Southern Ocean, but illegal fishing vessels can easily sidestep the directives: boats registered to non-CCAMLR member countries are not subject to the commission’s rules, making prosecution all but impossible. Before the 1990s, few people had heard of the toothfish. A few decades before at a port in Chile, Lee Lantz, an American seafood merchant on the hunt for new fish species, had come across a fish with buttery, mild flesh high in omega-3 fatty acids that was hard to overcook. But the toothfish, with fearsome teeth and a protruding lower jaw, looked as ugly as its name, so Lantz rebranded it as Chilean sea bass. It became so popular that a single fish could sell for thousands of dollars. By the mid-1990s, CCAMLR reported that illegal toothfish hauls had hit over 68,000 tonnes—more than twice the legal quota. Increased surveillance and arrests by countries like Australia and New Zealand have helped curb the poaching activity, but it remains a serious problem. Sea Shepherd’s Ocean Warrior was built as an anti-whaling vessel but has been used to combat illegal fishing. Photo courtesy of Sea Shepherd Selling the illegally caught fish is relatively easy to get away with if port inspectors do a poor job of investigating the vessel, explains Peter Horn, the project director for the Pew Charitable Trusts’ ending illegal fishing program. All the captain has to do is misreport the catch, claiming for instance that the crew caught one type of fish when in fact it caught another; lie about the quantity of fish caught; or pretend to have fished in a different area. The end result is a market with so many illegally caught fish that “there’s a reasonable chance that you have inadvertently bought some,” Horn says. For IUU fishing boats, the Southern Ocean is delightfully remote—they haul up fish nearly 1,500 kilometers from the southernmost edge of New Zealand’s territorial waters, where it’s difficult for even the closest countries to sustain regular coast guard vessel or aerial patrols. Before the STS-50 arrived on the scene, a notorious fleet of fishing vessels known as the Bandit 6 had been poaching toothfish in the Southern Ocean from 2003 to 2016. With the launch of Project Scale, Sea Shepherd began helping Interpol target the vessels and their owners, including a Spanish mafia group called Vidal Armadores. One takedown involved a 110-day chase led by a Sea Shepherd vessel across three oceans. The hunt for the illegal ship, the Thunder, ended in April 2015, when its Chilean captain intentionally sank the vessel off the west coast of Africa. Afterward, Project Scale investigators discovered the identity of the Thunder’s owner from his insurance claim, which included the loss of 32 tonnes of illegally caught toothfish. “This is how brazen they were,” says Hammarstedt. In 2015, a court in São Tomé and Príncipe, an island nation off the west coast of Africa, convicted the Thunder’s captain and two of its crew members on several charges tied to illegal fishing and collectively fined them over $17-million. By early 2016, the five other Bandit 6 vessels had met similar fates, and for a while, the Southern Ocean was free from major illegal fishing operations. With the Spanish vessels gone, the STS-50 moved in to fill the void. The STS-50 had been fishing illegally around the world at that point for eight years under a variety of names, likely selling its catch to middlemen who knew it was illegal, says Bergh of Stop Illegal Fishing. The crew would have changed often and it’s possible some would not have known their activities were criminal, but the senior officers like the Russian captain and the first mate would have been fully aware, says Bergh. It wasn’t until the fall of 2016 that authorities flagged the vessel for possible violations. After its crew unloaded what looked like toothfish in the port of Weihai, China, raising suspicions that it might have been illegally caught, officials conducted DNA testing that confirmed it was, in fact, toothfish. To legally catch toothfish, vessels must be registered in a country that is a member of CCAMLR—otherwise the catch falls into the category of “unregulated.” The STS-50 was registered to Cambodia, which is not a member. In any case, as Cambodian officials later confirmed, the boat’s registration was forged. But before anyone could stop it, the vessel fled across the Indian Ocean. In January 2017, New Zealand and Australia requested Interpol issue the purple notice, and officials in partner countries went on high alert. By this time, the vessel had been renamed the Sea Breeze and then again the Ayda. When it arrived at ports, the captain, Aleksandr Matveev, presented forged documents to obscure its identity and claimed the boat belonged to at least eight different flag states including Togo, Nigeria, and Bolivia—all countries with lax maritime laws. Registering a ship under one of these so-called flags of convenience is a common tactic used by owners of IUU fishing vessels since a ship generally falls under the jurisdiction of the flag state. The vessel’s owners disguised their identities through a convoluted network of shell companies—businesses that exist only on paper. A 2019 report by the Center to Combat Corruption and Cronyism notes that “large-scale reform is needed in the global fishing sector to improve how vessel owners report ownership information and prevent the exploitation of opaque jurisdictions and flag states.” Your browser does not support the video element. Before abandoning their pursuit of the STS-50, the Ocean Warrior crew flies a drone over the illegal vessel. Video courtesy of Sea Shepherd A year after the STS-50 left Weihai, the vessel returned to China and was arrested but fled the same day. The ship evaded authorities until February 2018, when the fisheries inspector in Madagascar found the suspicious document on board.  “Madagascar was really brilliant,” says Bergh, referring to the inspector’s decision to alert the IOTC. “They had their suspicions and sent them out.” Had they not done that, he adds, it might have taken the authorities far longer to track down the vessel. As soon as the STS-50 fled Fort Dauphin, various players, including FISH-i Africa and Stop Illegal Fishing, began tracking the vessel via its automatic identification system (AIS), which emits a location signal that can be picked up by radio equipment and satellites to help vessels avoid collisions at sea. Those groups shared that information with other players, including Jeulain at the Regional Maritime Information Fusion Center and officials in Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand. By pooling their various intelligence sources, Jeulain says, they could increase their strategic advantage on the STS-50. “You send the ball over to another player who can bring added value to the play,” he adds. On February 27, 2018, two weeks after the STS-50 had slipped away from Madagascar, Jeulain received another email, this time from one of his contacts in Maputo. The informant said the vessel had moored near Maputo a few hours earlier. The STS-50 had not requested permission to enter Mozambican waters, and authorities boarded the vessel to inspect it. They found fishing gear, though the boat was not authorized to fish. Mozambican officials arrested the vessel, brought it to port in Maputo, and confiscated the crew’s passports—20 Indonesian, eight Russian, and two Ukrainian. But two weeks later, on March 18, the STS-50 fled again. How such a large vessel wanted for illegal fishing could have escaped from a major port remains a mystery. (A person familiar with the case refuses to speculate on what may have happened but says that Mozambique is a country where “cash is helping you a lot.”) When news of the ship’s getaway reached Gary Orr, who monitors commercial fishing for the New Zealand government, the elation he had felt when the vessel was detained was quickly replaced by crushing disappointment. “The chase and the apprehension of the bad guys is what it’s all about if you’re an investigator; it’s what you live for,” Orr says. With investigators on high alert, the STS-50 tried to evade tracking by periodically switching off its AIS and using a generic Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number, a nine-digit code that is supposed to be unique to each vessel. With the generic identification number, the STS-50 was able to hide under other ships’ transmission signals, says Bergh, “a bit like everybody trying to talk on the same frequency on a radio.” Specialists at Trygg Mat Tracking (TMT), a Norwegian nonprofit that provides vessel tracking analysis to FISH-i Africa, were able to decipher the STS-50’s intermittent satellite signals and detect where the vessel really was. It was like playing a game of cat and mouse in an area larger than the Australian continent. On March 20, Jeulain’s phone pinged. It was a WhatsApp message from one of his regular informants, the captain of a fishing boat off the west coast of Madagascar. He had spotted the STS-50. The STS-50 was heading northeast, toward the port of Toliara on Madagascar’s west coast, just as TMT experts had thought. Bergh, who was kept abreast of the tracking efforts, concluded that, at its current speed, the vessel might be there in 14 to 16 hours. He fired off an email to Jeulain, notifying him of its likely destination. “OK Per,” Jeulain wrote back. “I have a network of informers at Tuliare [another name for Toliara] and Morombe. I will send the picture of the F/V [the STS-50] so that my network can spot it if it ever shows up.” At 63, the Ocean Warrior’s captain Mike Dicks had served as skipper on two previous Sea Shepherd campaigns. A former airline pilot in Hong Kong, Dicks was a keen sailor and had flirted with becoming a marine biologist. The previous summer, Dicks had helped arrest 15 Chinese vessels in East Timor for illegal fishing and human rights abuses. When officials from East Timor raided the boats, they found freezers jammed with sharks—many of them endangered. When Dicks received notice that the STS-50 had fled detention in Mozambique, he had to figure out where it would try to flee. Though TMT was tracking the ship, no one was certain where it was headed. “It was more of a guess-and-check type scenario,” as Orr puts it. A cyclone off the east coast of Madagascar left the STS-50 with just one likely escape route: northward up the Mozambique Channel and then east across the Indian Ocean into international waters. After leaving Madagascar, the STS-50 heads for international waters. Photo courtesy of Sea Shepherd A few days later, Dicks received position reports that the STS-50 had crossed the Mozambique Channel and was heading north along the west coast of Madagascar, as predicted. Dicks steered the Ocean Warrior southeast from Tanzania, hoping to intercept it. To conserve fuel, he kept the speed slow, gradually closing in on the STS-50 without raising suspicion in the other vessel’s crew that they were being pursued. Ahead, the STS-50 passed Comoros, off the north coast of Madagascar, and was headed east toward the international waters of the Indian Ocean—exactly as Dicks had guessed. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the STS-50 was a stateless vessel due to its forged paperwork, which meant that any country could seize it in international waters. Tanzania, which had sent officers out on the Ocean Warrior, had volunteered. “That was an amazing testament to Tanzania’s commitment for fighting environmental crime,” says Sea Shepherd’s Hammarstedt. Most countries are reluctant to go after rogue vessels. Now, Tanzania, with Sea Shepherd’s help, would be responsible for bringing the STS-50 back to port and footing the bill for prosecuting the vessel. But international waters were still a long way away. To get to where Tanzanian authorities could board the STS-50, the Ocean Warrior would have to travel far into the Indian Ocean, past the territorial waters of Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles—at least 1,800 kilometers from the Tanzanian coast, according to Dicks’s calculations—which put the ship at the far edge of its fuel supply. Without enough diesel, the Ocean Warrior would have to make the return trip on its electric engine—at a much slower pace—pushing the homeward journey to 10 days. There was a chance, though, that with permission from the relevant nation, the Ocean Warrior team could arrest the STS-50 in territorial waters. A view of the Ocean Warrior’s bridge. Photo courtesy of Sea Shepherd As the chase progressed, Dicks saw that it was becoming a logistical nightmare. How would they get the STS-50 all the way back to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s closest major port? Only three of the Tanzanian officials aboard the Ocean Warrior were armed and they would need to guard the 25 people aboard the STS-50 for the entire journey. These are the same people who had just escaped port twice in the past four weeks. What if they were aggressive? Or had guns? Dicks was not certain he could guarantee the safety of the Tanzanians or the other 18 people aboard the Ocean Warrior. Given Dicks’s growing concerns, Tanzania requested permission from Seychelles to seize the vessel while it was in Seychellois territorial waters, but their inquiries went unanswered. By this point, the Ocean Warrior had nearly caught up to the STS-50. Dicks kept them 24 to 32 kilometers away—close enough to see the STS-50 on the radar. As they approached international waters, it was looking increasingly unlikely that they could apprehend the STS-50. The decision to turn back just beyond the island of Mauritius was “gut wrenching,” says Dicks. “We’d been chasing them for a week and we just had to let it go.” Before turning around, Dicks steered the Ocean Warrior closer to the STS-50 while the crew deployed a drone to take pictures in hopes that it would help authorities eventually identify the vessel and capture it. The STS-50 charged on toward Indonesia, on the other side of the Indian Ocean. But it had picked the wrong country to escape to. With the STS-50 cutting across the ocean, Hammarstedt messaged Mas Achmad Santosa, the head of Indonesia’s storied task force for combating illegal fishing. Since 2014, the country, which contains 17,000 islands, has blown up more than 400 illegal fishing boats. In February 2016, the Indonesian navy, with Sea Shepherd assisting, had caught the last of the Bandit 6 ships—a vessel called the Viking. A few weeks later, Indonesian officials loaded the Viking with explosives and blew it up. The illegal fishing boat known as the Viking, captured before the STS-50, in Indonesian waters. Photo by ZUMA Press, Inc./Alamy Stock Photo “This is to serve as a deterrent to others,” Susi Pudjiastuti, Indonesia’s fisheries minister at the time, told a group of reporters as she stood on the beach while the Viking smoldered behind her. “You may go freely in the rest of the world, but once entering Indonesia, this is the consequence.” To Jeulain, Bergh, Hammarstedt, and the huge network of people invested in the STS-50’s capture, the end looked to be in sight. Indonesian authorities were ready to intercept the vessel as soon as it entered its waters. Still, no one knew exactly where the STS-50 was. Without the Ocean Warrior following directly behind the vessel, they had to rely on its AIS signal to determine its location, but the STS-50 was transmitting only occasionally, likely to keep the owner abreast of its location. Whenever the STS-50 signaled, the tracking experts in the network keeping watch would estimate its course until it transmitted another signal, 48 hours or so later. “When it gets closer to shore, that’s when it gets more tense,” Bergh says. As it approached the boundary for Indonesian waters, Bergh and his collaborators anxiously awaited that final, crucial signal that would allow the Indonesian navy to intercept the vessel. The Indonesian government takes an aggressive approach to defeating illegal fishing vessels, claiming to have sunk hundreds of such ships in its waters. Photo by Januar/AFP via Getty Images “We knew it was approaching Indonesia, but we hadn’t seen it in a long time,” Bergh says, referring to an 18-hour period when the STS-50’s signal went dark. “Everyone was asking, ‘Where is it? Where is it?’” Finally, they saw it—a little blip coming toward Banda Aceh. As soon as the STS-50 entered Indonesian waters, two Indonesian navy vessels intercepted it and asked to board, which the captain and crew allowed. Usually people on board fishing vessels don’t resist, says an official who asked not to be named. Especially with Indonesia’s reputation: “How do I put it?” he says. “They’re very … efficient … with law enforcement.” On the high seas, the bad guys have almost always gotten away—a frustrating reality of the seemingly Sisyphean task of policing lawbreakers in such a vast arena. By the time the Ocean Warrior arrived back in Dar es Salaam and refueled, only four days of its originally scheduled patrol were left. Dicks steered the vessel up the Tanzanian coast toward the Kenyan border and arrested a rickety wooden boat that was smuggling migrants. “Small fry, really,” says Dicks. The STS-50 managed to fish illegally for years because its captain had a knack for making the ship scarce. This animation, intended to illustrate the timeline of the STS-50’s capture, provides only an approximation of the ship’s route across the ocean. Animation by Katrina Pyne The STS-50 was not small fry, but punishing those responsible for the vessel’s crimes proved more difficult than catching it. The captain was sentenced to a mere four months in Indonesian prison and fined $14,000 by an Indonesian court for illegal fishing. The other officers were deported back to Russia and Ukraine, their home countries. Still, punishing the real perpetrators was more difficult. “To this day, we still can’t target the owners,” Pudjiastuti said at a press conference at her office in Jakarta, Indonesia, in early 2019. “The beneficial owners aren’t clear, so it’s difficult for us to track them down.” After the arrest, Interpol’s digital forensics teams pored over the intelligence contained within the fishing vessel—its on-board computer systems, navigational instruments, and the captain’s mobile phone—helping authorities piece together the wider criminal web that the vessel operated in. Rather than blow up the captured illegal vessel, Indonesia has converted the STS-50 into one of its maritime policing boats. Indonesian guards stand with crew members from the STS-50 after the ship’s capture in April 2018. Photo by AFP via Getty Images In the fisheries management world, many people see capturing illegal fishing vessels as government work. That attitude has always frustrated Bergh. If illegal vessels can easily slip between borders, capturing them requires not only governments—which tend to have limited and confidential intelligence—but also, evidently, many other players working together. “These cases are puzzles,” he says. Some organizations dedicate years to investigating certain criminals or cases—when that hard-won information is shared with other agencies, everyone benefits, he adds. For Bergh, the apprehension of the STS-50 demonstrates what is possible when governments, law enforcement, and civil society work across the political boundaries that once constrained them. And though Bergh acknowledges that stopping one vessel doesn’t turn the tide against illegal fishing, it does show that the net is tightening. Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that 312 IUU fishing vessels are in operation. The number has been updated. Cite this Article:

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Bing,Two Vessels Catch Fire After Missile Strikes off Yemen," 


June 9, 2024

 © lesniewski / Adobe Stock Two ships caught on fire after being hit by projectiles off Yemen's Aden, two UK maritime agencies reported on Sunday. The British security firm Ambrey said on Sunday an Antigua- and Barbuda-flagged general cargo ship was struck by a missile 83 nautical miles southeast of Aden and caught fire. The fire was later contained. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said it had received a report from a captain of a vessel of an incident 80 nautical miles southeast of Aden. ""The ship was heading southwest along the Gulf of Aden at a speed of 8.2 knots when the forward station was struck by a missile. A fire started but was neutralised,"" Ambrey said in an advisory note. ""A second missile was sighted but did not hit the ship. Persons on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident."" Ambrey said the ship changed course to port and increased speed, adding that ""no injuries were reported."" Separately, Ambrey and UKMTO said they had received a report about another incident 70 nautical miles southwest of Aden. ""The master reports that the vessel was hit by an unknown projectile on the aft section, which resulted in a fire. Damage control is underway,"" UKMTO said in advisory note. They added that no casualties were reported and the vessel was proceeding to its next port of call. The Houthi militia, which controls the most populous parts of Yemen and is aligned with Iran, has attacked ships off its coast for months, saying it is acting in solidarity with Palestinians fighting Israel in Gaza. Houthi fighters have launched drone and missile attacks in the Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden, forcing shippers since November to take longer and more costly journeys around southern Africa. The United States and Britain have carried out strikes against Houthi targets in response to the attacks. The UKMTO said on Sunday that it had received a report of a missile attack on a merchant vessel 89 nautical miles southwest of Yemen's port city of Aden. ""Reporting suggests that the vessel has been hit,"" an advisory note from UKMTO said, but added that the vessel did not sustain any casualties and that it was proceeding to its next port of call.

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Bing,"Suspected attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels sees missiles strike ship in Gulf of Aden, sparking blaze"," A suspected attack Thursday by Yemen’s Houthi rebels saw missiles strike a ship in the Gulf of Aden, authorities said, setting the vessel ablaze in what would be the latest such assault in their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war. The attack happened in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre said. It said the vessel caught fire in the attack. The private security firm Ambrey said a merchant vessel made a radio distress call saying it had been struck by a missile. The ship “was en route from Malaysia to Venice, Italy,” Ambrey said. It added that the ship was “aligned with the Houthi target profile,” without elaborating. Later on Thursday, the UKMTO reported a second suspected attack off Yemen’s port city of Hodeida, but said the blast happened away from the vessel and did not damage it. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge Thursday’s attacks, but it typically takes the rebels hours or even days to claim them. The attack follows the Houthis launching a boat-borne bomb attack against a commercial ship in the Red Sea on Wednesday. The Houthis, who seized Yemen’s capital nearly a decade ago and have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition since shortly after, have been targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor. They say the attacks are aimed at stopping the war and supporting the Palestinians, though the attacks often target vessels that have nothing to do with the conflict. The war in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there, according to Gaza health officials, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. A U.S.-led air strike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say. Also Thursday, the Washington-based National Democratic Institute said three of its staff were detained by the Houthis earlier this month. Their detention comes as staff of United Nations agencies and those working for aid groups also have been detained in a widening crackdown by the rebels. “This arbitrary and inhumane treatment of Yemeni citizens involved in humanitarian assistance, diplomacy, democracy and human rights, peacemaking and civil society development is entirely without foundation and must be ended immediately,” the institute said. It called for the “swift release by the Houthi regime of our staff, and of all individuals who have been unjustly detained.” The institute is a democracy promotion organization that has worked in Yemen since 1993. It receives funding from the U.S. government and others.

Vessel caught misreporting catch amount,Bing,Two vessels catch fire after missile strikes off Yemen's Aden," CAIRO (Reuters) -Two ships caught on fire after being hit by projectiles off Yemen's Aden, two UK maritime agencies reported on Sunday. The British security firm Ambrey said on Sunday an Antigua- and Barbuda-flagged general cargo ship was struck by a missile 83 nautical miles southeast of Aden and caught fire. The fire was later contained. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said it had received a report from a captain of a vessel of an incident 80 nautical miles southeast of Aden. ""The ship was heading southwest along the Gulf of Aden at a speed of 8.2 knots when the forward station was struck by a missile. A fire started but was neutralised,"" Ambrey said in an advisory note. ""A second missile was sighted but did not hit the ship. Persons on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident."" Ambrey said the ship changed course to port and increased speed, adding that ""no injuries were reported."" Separately, Ambrey and UKMTO said they had received a report about another incident 70 nautical miles southwest of Aden. ""The master reports that the vessel was hit by an unknown projectile on the aft section, which resulted in a fire. Damage control is underway,"" UKMTO said in advisory note. They added that no casualties were reported and the vessel was proceeding to its next port of call. The Houthi militia, which controls the most populous parts of Yemen and is aligned with Iran, has attacked ships off its coast for months, saying it is acting in solidarity with Palestinians fighting Israel in Gaza. Houthi fighters have launched drone and missile attacks in the Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden, forcing shippers since November to take longer and more costly journeys around southern Africa. The United States and Britain have carried out strikes against Houthi targets in response to the attacks.

             Archived News Para Notícias en Español A federal jury in Central Islip, New York, convicted a Long Island fisherman today for crimes associated with his captainship of the trawler New Age from 2014 to 2017. The jury unanimously convicted Christopher Winkler of Montauk, New York, of one count of federal criminal conspiracy, two counts of mail fraud and two counts of obstruction of justice. On at least 200 fishing trips, Winkler targeted summer flounder (fluke) and black sea bass and harvested those fish in excess of quotas and state trip limits. He also falsified Fishing Vessel Trip Reports (FVTRs) for those trips. His co-conspirators falsified corresponding dealer reports. Both sets of false documents were used to cover up fish that Winkler took in excess of quotas. “Fluke and black sea bass play a vital part in our marine ecosystem and quotas are designed to prevent overfishing and stabilize populations for the public good,” said Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. “We will continue to seek justice against those who flout laws that protect fisheries and the fishing industry.” “While most U.S. fishermen follow the law, some still feel that they are above it,” said Michael Henry, Acting Assistant Director of NOAA's Office of Law Enforcement, Northeast Division. “It is our job to protect honest fishermen and good actors and this verdict should serve as a reminder that those who break the rules will be held accountable.” Fishing quotas for fluke and black sea bass were designed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation to ensure a long-term, sustainable population of the fish. As part of the fisheries management plan, NOAA requires fishing captains like Winkler to accurately complete an FVTR at the end of each fishing trip. Winkler was required to declare his catch – which included fish species and weights – to NOAA and the State of New York. To cover up his illicit harvest and landings, Winkler falsified approximately 200 FVTRs that he then mailed to NOAA. Similarly, a fish dealer – which is the first company that buys fish directly from a fishing vessel –must specify what it purchases on a federal form known as a dealer report. NOAA uses this information to set policies designed to provide for biologically and economically viable fish stocks. Winkler sold illegal fish to three fish dealers. Because a mismatch between FVTRs and dealer reports would have alerted fisheries statisticians and enforcement personnel, Winkler’s co-conspirators falsified dealer reports to cover up that fish were taken in excess of quotas. The entire scam netted an overharvest of approximately 200,000 pounds of fluke and black sea bass, valued conservatively at least at $750,000 (wholesale). In a related case, Bryan Gosman and Asa Gosman of Bob Gosman Co. Inc. – a Montauk-based fish dealer – previously pleaded guilty to a charge of criminally conspiring with Christopher Winkler in November 2021. They testified at the trial against Winkler. It was revealed during the trial that Bryan Gosman had served as a lookout for Winkler on at least 16 occasions during the conspiracy, often communicating by text before the defendant arrived at the dock. Sentencing for all three defendants will be scheduled by the court. NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement investigated the case as part of Operation One-Way Chandelier. Christopher L. Hale and Kenneth Nelson of the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section prosecuted the case, with logistical support from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. A Massachusetts man was arrested today in Hanson, Massachusetts, for allegedly possessing dogs for participation in a dogfighting venture at his Massachusetts home. A Florida man pleaded guilty today to federal criminal charges for conspiring to illegally export thousands of turtles to Germany and Hong Kong, and falsifying documents to conceal his conduct.  Northridge Construction Corporation pleaded guilty to criminal charges in federal court in Central Islip, New York.

Vessel caught falsifying fishing logs,Google,FACT CHECK: No reports of Taiwan attacking Chinese fishing vessels,"  SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. Claim: Taiwan fired water cannons and nearly destroyed Chinese fishing vessels recently caught operating in its waters. Why we fact-checked this:  The YouTube video with the claim was posted on November 13 by a prominent Filipino channel with 328,000 subscribers. As of writing, the video has 14,857 views and 443 likes.  In the video, the narrator claims: “Ilang mga Chinese fishing vessel ang tila baga halos mawasak dahil sa pagbobomba ng water cannons ng Taiwan sa kanila.” (Several Chinese fishing vessels were nearly destroyed because Taiwan fired water cannons at them.)  The bottom line: Taiwan has been intercepting Chinese fishing vessels operating within its maritime borders, but it has not used water cannons.  Video inconsistency: The YouTube video is an inconsistent amalgamation of conflicting reports. The title and description of the video both claim, “Binomba ng South Korean Coast Guard ang mga illegal Chinese fishing vessel” (South Korean Coast Guard bombed illegal Chinese fishing vessels), but the rest of the video claims that it was Taiwan that conducted the supposed attack. After mentioning it in the introduction, the narrator does not go into detail about the supposed attack. Instead, the video discusses a Taiwan News report on illegal Chinese fishing within Taiwan’s borders; there is no mention of any attacks in the video or the report. The article only says that to address the illegal incursions, Taiwan has “utilized radar technology, surveillance, and Coast Guard patrols to strengthen the monitoring of its borders.” Unverified claims: There are no reputable sources substantiating the claim of recent water cannon attacks by Taiwan against Chinese fishing boats. In fact, the latest news report involving Chinese fishing boats in Taiwan’s waters was from October. According to the article, the Taiwanese coast guard intercepted 652 Chinese vessels from January to September 2023 for illegally fishing and mining sand. China-Taiwan relations: China claims democratically-governed Taiwan as its territory. Taiwan has reported regular Chinese military patrols and drills near the island, with the latest involving nine Chinese aircraft crossing the Taiwan Strait and warships carrying out “combat readiness patrols” on November 19.  Pervasive misinformation: False claims about attacks on Chinese vessels have been circulating amid Beijing’s aggressive militant tactics in disputed waters.  Rappler has debunked many of these false claims: – Miguel Batallones/Rappler.com Miguel Batallones is a graduate of Rappler’s fact-checking mentorship program.

 California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) law enforcement uncovered a network of recreational fishermen engaged in commercial fishing businesses with no regard to limits, documentation or adhering to the highly regulated business practices of the commercial fishing industry. The investigation revealed more than 5,500 pounds of fish were unlawfully bought and sold for more than $26,000. Wildlife officers investigated David Haworth, 60, of San Diego, and Nicholas Haworth, 28, of La Jolla, who were buying and selling recreationally caught fish, failing to land fish (documenting the fish once it reaches land), facilitating the operation of an unlicensed fish business and falsifying landing documents to hide their poaching crimes. CDFW officers spent more than six months on the investigation revealing evidence that the Haworths were illegally buying, and re-selling recreationally caught fish through associations with a network of recreational fishermen. Wildlife officers obtained evidence that Lucas Dirkse, 29, of San Diego, Mitchell Bradford, 36, of San Diego, Brandon Demelo, 24, of San Diego, Tanner Whitmarsh, 30, of El Cajon, Trevor Whitmarsh, 25, of El Cajon and David Brown, 68, of San Diego, were selling fish to the Haworths. By selling fish to the Haworths, participants engaged in numerous illegal fishing activities including failure to register as a commercial fishing vessel, failing to obtain required permits through the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, selling fish caught on a commercial passenger fishing vessel and falsifying documents among many more violations. “Letting these crimes continue without robust enforcement and prosecution jeopardizes the sustainability of California’s commercial fishing industry and the majority of those commercial fishers who comply with the law,” said Nathaniel Arnold, acting chief of CDFW’s Law Enforcement Division. “Illegal sales of recreationally caught fish bypasses both paths for sampling and accounting of total catch.” “Many of us live in San Diego because we appreciate the region’s natural wonders, including the fish that populate our rivers and oceans,” said San Diego City Attorney Mara W. Elliott. “California’s strict environmental laws exist for one reason: to protect nature and to ensure its existence for generations to come. Our ability to enjoy the outdoors depends on vigorous enforcement and prosecution of the laws that preserve our surroundings.” California fisheries biologists and their federal partners manage the recreational and commercial fishing sectors separately, and each has individual rules and regulations to ensure the harvest of marine species is sustainable. Many fish stocks have strict quotas, limiting total commercial catch and restricting recreational catches. Both state and federal scientists collect biological data for landed fish, which feeds into abundance estimates, international negotiations, and domestic management. Commercial catches are carefully weighed and reported when taken off the boat to account for the amount removed from the fish populations. Estimates of recreational catch are also reported, sampled at launch areas, and used in stock assessments and management. ### Media Contact:

Vessel caught falsifying fishing logs,Google,Florida fishing: Yahoo for wahoo! Live blue runners yield 8 wahoo," Did you enjoy your false spring? You know, when it warmed up nicely only to get a cold snap again? That'll only happen about two more times before spring actually starts. It messes up the plants, like mango trees are in full bloom, and the fish, too. The fishing patterns back up slightly for a few days, then return to normal. So look for pompano to begin moving north soon, along with the beach sharks — spinners, blacktips and hammerheads that eat the other two. And snook fishing and tripletail fishing will be good again. For complete fishing regulations in Florida go to MyFWC.com. Pompano and whiting surf fishing tournament to benefit the Indian RiverKeeper will be March 23-24 at Hutchinson Island beaches. Entry fee: $50 includes free bag of Fish Gum, Pompano Rich rig, Bag of Fishbites and raffle ticket. Winners receive prizes. To register go to theindianriverkeeper.org/sand-spike-shootout The return of the popular DOA Paddlers Only Fishing Tournament will be April 12-13 at River Palm Cottages in Jensen Beach. The tournament will be limited to 130 entrants who will fish exclusively with a DOA Lure Package provided at the captains meeting the night prior to the event and aboard kayaks, canoes or stand-up paddleboards only. Anglers will fish for prizes in inshore slam (snook, trout, redfish), snook, tarpon and mystery fish divisions in a catch, photo, release longest inches format. For complete rules and prizes, go to DOALures.com for more information. Offshore: There has been decent fishing offshore for kingfish and Spanish mackerel in 20 to 60 feet of water. Nothing large on the kingfish, most are in the 15-18 pound range. Spanish mackerel have been just outside the first reef off the Vero Cove, Rio Mar down to Avalon Beach. Inshore: Snook can be caught on the points of spoil islands from Grant to Vero Beach. Use live sardines, live mullet or even live shrimp around catwalks, bridges and seawalls. Sheepshead, croaker, black drum, flounder, redfish and trout are other possible catches. Freshwater: Bass fishing will be excellent coming of the full moon. Look for bass to be around the edges of lakes, ponds and canals on the beds and coming off the beds after spawning. Speckled perch fishing is still pretty steady at Blue Cypress and Stick Marsh. Offshore: Yahoo for wahoo. That's what Capt. Richard Hunt of Little Adam charters in Fort Pierce said this week. On Feb. 17, he and his charters boated not one, not two, but eight wahoo while fishing off the inlet with live blue runners. No high speed trolling for them. Inshore: Fish around docks, bridges, jetties, seawalls and the Turning Basin at night for shots at springtime snook. Fish with 1-ounce flare hawk type jigs during the beginning of the outgoing tide. A few redfish, tripletail and trout have been caught in the lagoon recently using live greenies. Surf: It's been hit and miss lately at Hutchinson Island beaches. On days where it has been calm enough to fish, anglers are struggling to catch pompano, but are finding a decent bluefish bite, Spanish mackerel and jacks. Offshore: One big catch is starting to get everyone's attention: An estimated 500-pound swordfish. More on that later. Snapper and kingfish fishing on the reefs in 60-70 feet of water has been steady. Triggerfish, porgies and lane snapper are rounding out the catches. Inshore: The St. Lucie River is being affected by Lake O discharges which began Feb. 17. While normally the open gates serve as like a dinner bell to snook, the flow rate has been high so snook are probably staging downstream somewhere. When the Army Corps backs off on the flow rate, the snook will probably move closer to the gates within casting range of a 20-pound rod with a 1-ounce chartreuse flare hawk jig. The high lake at 16 feet and change means the water is higher in the northern and western portions of the lake, Bass fishing is pretty good in that area following the full moon. Speckled perch fishing remains steady at King's Bar and in the river. Ed Killer is the outdoors writer for TCPalm. Email your fishing reports and photos to ed.killer@tcpalm.com.",2024-02-22

 Leave your feedback An investigation into Chinese fishing fleets and processing centers has discovered that seafood produced with forced labor is making its way to American dinner tables. That's despite a U.S. ban on imports made by workers from China’s Xinjiang province. That region is home to Muslim minority Uyghurs who have been the victims of well-documented human rights violations. John Yang reports.

Amna Nawaz: An investigation into Chinese fishing fleets and processing centers has discovered that seafood produced with forced labor is making its way to American dinner tables. That's despite a U.S. ban on imports made by workers from China's Xinjiang province. The region in northwest China is home to Muslim minority Uyghurs, who have been the victims of well-documented human rights violations. John Yang has more. If you buy frozen seafood at the grocery store or order fish at a chain restaurant, chances are pretty good that it was caught by a Chinese fishing vessel or processed in a Chinese plant. China runs what may be the largest maritime operation ever known. An investigation by the not-for-profit journalism organization called The Outlaw Ocean Project has documented human rights, labor, and environmental concerns related to the Chinese fleet. As Outlaw Ocean founder Ian Urbina tells us in this excerpt from the group's reporting, Chinese fishing ships rely on forced labor. Ian Urbina, Executive Editor, The Outlaw Ocean Project: Foreign journalists are generally forbidden from reporting in Xinjiang. So the team of investigators had to rely on a range of publicly available materials, including company newsletters, local news reports, trade data, satellite imagery, and social media. Man: But the real kind of key to our investigation became the use of the Chinese version of TikTok, which is called Douyin. Ian Urbina: Videos posted by Uyghurs from seafood plants show that many live in military-style dormitories under the watch of security personnel. Uyghur workers' dorms are often searched, and if a Koran or other contraband is found, the owner may be sent to a reeducation camp. Uyghurs' social media posts are also closely monitored by Chinese online censors. Posting anything critical of the regime could quickly land them in a detention center. But it appears that many Uyghurs have found a way to include cryptic messages in their videos to convey their suffering while also bypassing the Chinese censors. Thousands of tons of seafood processed in China with forced labor continue to enter the United States and Europe. Importers sent their products to major supermarkets around the world, including Walmart, Kroger, Tesco, and Carrefour. The importers also sent seafood to Cisco, the global food service giant that supplies more than 400,000 restaurants in the U.S. alone. Over the past five years, the U.S. government spent more than $200 million to buy seafood from importers' linked to Uyghur labor for use in military bases, federal prisons, and public schools. John Yang: This investigation represents four years of work by Ian Urbina, the executive editor of The Outlaw Ocean Project. And how did you find that this labor, putting the Uyghurs to work in these processing plants, sort of fit in, in the Chinese overall strategy in dealing with the Uyghurs? The Uyghurs are a Muslim minority in China. Ian Urbina: Yes. I mean, there's this general policy from the Chinese government to try to relocate many of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and disperse them elsewhere in the country to sort of pacify the population, if you will. So there's a huge state-run labor transfer program with thousands of Uyghurs that are forcibly removed from this inland province, Xinjiang, and transported 2,000 miles away to the other side of the country to work in the factories. And it's all part of an effort to sort of bring this restive province under control. John Yang: Ian, you talked to about more than two dozen of the crew members, people who worked on these ships. What did they tell you about the conditions they worked under and the conditions of their employment? Ian Urbina: Yes, I mean, we found a lot of forced labor and trafficked labor. Before COVID, a lot of these workers are Indonesian, after COVID, largely rural Chinese. They're pretty nervous to talk openly when we were on board, but you could see the conditions. There are a lot of reports of violence on board and neglect, severe neglect. John Yang: And these ships often don't return to port for two years, stay at sea for two years. How did you manage to talk to these people? Ian Urbina: Yes, it was a process. Typically, it takes several days just to get out to the fishing grounds or on the high seas. Once we're out there, we make radio contact with the captain. We try to warm the captain up and see if he will let us on board. If not, oftentimes, the ships would flee and we'd get and board a faster vote called a skiff and follow the fishing ships. And, in those cases, we'd put messages in a bottle asking questions of the crew in Bahasa Indonesian, or Chinese and English, and throw the bottles onto the back of the ship and then follow them until the crew threw the bottles back with answers. John Yang: And not only answers, but some of them asking for help, some of them giving you phone numbers. Ian Urbina: Yes. The most useful thing were the phone numbers, because then we could contact families back home in Indonesia or China and ask those families how long they'd been gone and sort of what they knew of their lost family. John Yang: You also found violations of law and the way they fished and also environmental violations. Ian Urbina: Yes, many cases of shark-finning, of invasions of sovereignty. So this is a huge fleet, and often these vessels are aggressively going into waters where they're forbidden, Argentinean, Chilean, Ecuadorian waters, where they're not allowed. So, we documented those cases just to show how pervasive the problem is. John Yang: And how are they able to escape enforcement and escape inspection and that sort of thing? Ian Urbina: These vessels largely are on the high seas, and this is an area that's very hard to get to. The vessels are in constant motion. And most countries around the world don't have navies out there patrolling their own waters, much less the high seas. So these are working places that are largely out of reach of governments. And that's why they can do as they please. John Yang: And there were also signs that these ships were doing more than fishing or fishing for other things in a way. Ian Urbina: Yes, I mean, China's fishing fleet is in many ways sort of an arm of its geopolitical agenda. It's sort of a projection of power. And so, if you look at places like the South China Sea, contested waters in that area, the fishing fleet is essentially acting as a civilian militia. And you have enough fishing vessels there that they can crowd around other countries vessels and crowd around islands that are in contested waters and sort of establish sovereignty and show muscle. John Yang: It's an ambitious project, and you found out some very interesting things. Now, where can people read and see your reporting? Ian Urbina: With ""The New Yorker"" on their Web site. John Yang: Very good. Ian Urbina, the founder and executive editor of The Outlaw Ocean Project, thank you very much. Ian Urbina: Thanks for having me.

Vessel caught falsifying fishing logs,Google,"Cape Cod Fishing Report- August 31, 2023","  More albies fill in Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds, stripers and blues chase peanuts and mackerel in the Canal, and bonito and sea bass are biting south of the Vineyard. Here one day, gone the next. Knowing how fast albies are, I suppose I should have expected them to disappear after the wind direction shifted 180 degrees from southwest to northeast between Wednesday and Thursday. Such a significant change in conditions in such a short time typically stirs things up a bit. Albies are finally beginning to fill in around Vineyard Sound, but so far, they have not made their way into Buzzards Bay. Anglers are catching them on casting jigs as far down as the Elizabeths and in Woods Hole, but they can be very picky at times. On Wednesday I witnessed some frothing feeds in the slop on the south side, but the fish refused just about everything I put in front of them. Meanwhile, other kayak anglers were hooking into fish no problem by using jigs in the “electric chicken” color combo of pink and chartreuse. I did manage to stick one on an Albie Snax, but that fish popped off the hook. Thankfully, I was able to boat my first kayak albie of the season earlier that morning before the madness ensued. It exploded on albie whore fly that I dragged behind a 1-ounce casting egg. Although the albies have been in for a couple weeks, it’s still pretty early. The fishing will only improve from here. Small bluefish are sticking around on the south side between Craigville Beach and Nobska Light, but there are a few larger fish in the mix. I saw a couple wanna-be gators tail slapping the surface as they leapt through the chop in pursuit of bait earlier this week. They’re not quite snappers or cocktails, but not quite gator status either. These blues were that perfect eater size. You know, the type of bluefish that pysch you up thinking you’re pulling up to an albie blitz, only to have your jig bitten clean off. There are some larger bluefish in the Canal this week, along with schoolie stripers and a few slot-size fish. But if you’re looking for consistent bluefish action, Squibnocket is the place to be according to Captain Kurt Freund of Fishsticks Charters on Martha’s Vineyard. Small craft advisories have kept them at the dock for a few days, but when the skipper has gotten out, his charters have had mixed results. Their half-day trips have focused on bottom fishing for sea bass and fluke, and they’ve had to pick through a lot of shorts to find a few keepers. Longer trips provide more time to travel, and they’ve been able to put together a better bite further from home. On Sunday, the skipper took Martin Levenglick and family out to check out the Hooter and Paradise, which, he said, was a ghost town. They pressed on into the Nantucket Sound shoals and finally found some fish on Shovelful Shoal. Small bluefish and big black sea bass saved the day and provided plenty of fllets for a family dinner. Then, on Monday and Tuesday, Kurt made it out to Squibnocket where Eric Gustafson put the first bonito of the season, a 6 pounder, in the boat. They also caught bluefish of all sizes, along with scup, sea bass, fluke and a few tautog. And while Tuesday’s weather wasn’t the best, by preparing for the conditions and keeping an eye on the radar/forecast, their group was able to fish comfortably in their rain gear. Upon returning to Squibnocket with another charter, Gardner Stock fulfilled a 6-year quest to catch his first bonito, which was joined by bluefish of all sizes and a hefty 12-pounder. They also managed to catch a handful of scup and sea bass that would later go into ceviche. To the east, on Nantucket, Rick Ramos reports that the 1st Annual August Blues Tournament is coming to a close this week and final winners will be announced on September 1st. The week 4 winners for largest bluefish are: Following the Nantucket Blues Tournament, anglers have plenty more to look forward to. The 18th Annual Nantucket Inshore Classic, which is open to all local and visiting anglers with great opportunities to catch bluefish, striped bass, false albacore and bonito while supporting the Nantucket Angler’s Club Scholarship fund. Rick reported that beach fishing is improving as albies continue to fill in, and with Great Point access now open due to the last of the piping plovers leaving, anglers have been able to connect with bonito and albies on the inside to the North Lot. Snapper blues also continue to swarm the area for surfcasters. From the boat, Captain Corey Gammill of Bill Fisher Outfitters, reported that the East side of the island is loaded with bigger bluefish from Coskata down to Sankaty. Bonito fishing reported as better on the south shore with a consistent bite on the Miacomet Rip to Tom Nevers.  Albies and bonito are on the Bonito Bar and there are a lot of snapper blues to the west end of the island. Rick also reported that there has been an abundance of brown sharks around Nantucket this season. Dan Holmes of ACK Surfcasting reported that shark fishing has been fantastic while giving opportunities to support shark tagging initiatives that provide scientists with important information on life histories, population sizes, movement and migratory patterns, all of which are important for shark conservation. Dan shared that there have been four reported sand tiger sharks caught on Nantucket this summer and he had the opportunity to tag a 110-inch tiger this past weekend. Rick mentioned “As a friendly reminder to anyone interested in shark fishing, please be prepared with a good understanding of proper handling, hook removal, release and the right gear for the job.  Remember that all recreational shark anglers are required to use non-offset circle hooks.  If fishing from shore, be sure to check with state officials to make sure you follow all local laws.” Back across the sound, Evan Eastman at Eastman’s Sport and Tackle in Falmouth said he went out on Monday for albies near Hedge Fence, but didn’t see too much besides marking some fish beneath the boat. So, he headed over to Nobska and it was overcrowded with boats and kayaks and a small school of pressured fish. After making a move, they found more albies stacked between Robinsons Hole and Quicks Hole. He also mentioned that the Cotuit area seems to have a good number of albies, although bluefish have been mixed in, which is consistent with what many anglers on the south side are experiencing. On top of the hardtails reports, Evan said a customer of his was catching some decent stripers in the backwaters around Bourne and Cataumet earlier this week. They weren’t anything to write home about, but it’s nice to hear of some bass being caught in Buzzards Bay an not just in the Cape Cod Canal. And speaking of the Canal, Ditch veteran East End Eddie Doherty reports: Staying true to Eddie’s report, Connor at Red Top Sporting Goods in Buzzards Bay said the Canal is packed with bluefish, and with them are a fair amount of slot-size striped bass, with some under and some overs. They’re feeding on macks and peanut bunker, with topwater being the main producer of fish in the morning, and transitioning to a jig bite later in the day. Connor mentioned that the shop should be getting more FishLab soft macks restocked very soon, so for all you Canal regulars, get them while you can. In other news, Connor shared that albies were pushing west in Vineyard Sound earlier this week. He found some finicky schools around Nobska and Woods Hole, but they were very quick up and down. If the albies keep moving west, they should be in Buzzards Bay any day. And speaking of Buzzards Bay, there’s been an uptick in keeper fluke activity around the Mashnee Flats. Grab your Gulp and bucktails to put a few keepers on the table over the long weekend. Also remaining hopeful for albies in Buzzards Bay were the guys at Macos Bait and Tackle. They said albies are being caught around the Islands with more consistency and now that there are more fish in Woods Hole, they should begin to peel out of the Sound and up into Buzzards, where there is a buffet of baitfish moving in and out of the harbors, just waiting to be gobbled down. The fishing in the Canal, they added, has been hit or miss at times, with the most reliable bite being stripers from schoolie to slot size taking topwaters in the West End most mornings around sunrise. Boost your leader to a higher breaking strength if you want to keep your plugs, because blues are mixed in with them. Ben at Sports Port Bait and Tackle in Hyannis also experienced the inconvenience of ravaged soft plastics on account of small bluefish mixing in with albie schools. He did say, however, that Tuesday was probably his best day of albie fishing ever, landing 14 fish in sloppy conditions. Ben said the albies were clearly eating bay anchovies, but they weren’t taking jigs; instead, they were all over the Albie Snax, while the jigs made them a bit more picky and indecisive. He did land two on jigs out of the 14, before discovering that Snax were the key. Unfortunately, some of those Snax were sacrificed to the bellies of cocktail blues. He also saw one angler next to him pull a Spanish mackerel from the albie schools, but the macks don’t seem to be in as thick as they have been in years past. Perhaps more will show in the coming weeks. On the striped bass front, Ben said Barnstable Harbor continues to produce some consistent striper reports, with the fish most actively feeding at night on plugs. Bottom fishing has been slow if you’re looking for a meal, but Ben said he was catching short sea bass every drop earlier this week, which, going into a holiday weekend, is a great way to entertain young ones and get them hooked on the sport. When I spoke to Captain Cam Faria of Cambo Charters, he told me that sea bass fishing is lights out south of the Vineyard.  He is finding a ton of bluefish there too, and noted that the bluefish are getting smaller with lots of 3- and 4-pound fish, which he was happy to see because they’re the perfect size for bluefin tuna bait. Cam also reported finding good numbers of chicken mahi south of the Vineyard, and he even spotted some tuna while down there sea bassing. The commercial season reopens on Sunday, so he’s keeping an eye on the conditions and hoping to get out there in search of some giants, whether that be in Cape Cod Bay, south of the Islands, or out east. From Cape Cod Bay and the Outer Cape, Captain Elena Rice of Reel Deal Fishing Charters in Truro reported that bluefin tuna have been crushing the RonZ this week, with the silver color producing hook-ups on good sized bluefin tuna when conditions seem otherwise not so great. Their 15 year-old son, Merrick, recently caught a 58-inch tuna on a RonZ. And while the silver RonZ has been bringing fish to the boat, Elena noted that they are still dealing with some inconsistency in the tuna bite, but it is improving and should continue to do so rolling into September. She said the Reel Deal boats have openings starting in early October for anyone looking to reserve a charter. The skipper also mentioned that striped bass and blues are still hitting well, although this time of year they tend to see bonito in the area too, which has not happened yet. This weekend, expect a fair amount of boat traffic. With Sunday being the only exception, the weekend wind and weather conditions look beautiful. Temperatures in the low 70’s with a slight breeze are prime inshore fishing conditions, and if I had to guess, there will be plenty of boats making the run south of the Vineyard again this weekend. It sounds like there have been some promising signs of life to the east as well, according to Captain Cam Faria. The inshore scene has really exploded with more albies in Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds, bonito off the south side of the Vineyard, where anglers can also find bluefish of all sizes, and some good sea bass fishing as well. Bonito, bluefish and sea bass sounds like a pretty stellar day to me. Back between Cape and the Islands, albies are taking jigs, soft plastics and flies; if you’re like me, keep 2 or 3 rods rigged up with one of each of the aforementioned offerings to boost your odds at hooking up without having to constantly cut and retie. It makes more sense for kayak anglers, who are more spatially limited compared to boaters. You’ll waste less time fumbling around with pliers/line cutters and hooks with an extra rod or two. On my kayak, I keep a jig rod, an Albie Snax rod, and a casting egg-and-fly setup. Scup are still biting on bottom in Vineyard and Nantucket Sounds, and if you are lucky, you may drop down into some keeper sea bass. They’re on the move. Out of boredom, I dropped my Exo Jig to the bottom on the past few albie trips and was able to bring a couple just-barely-keeper sea bass to hand. The sea bass season closes on September 7, so this time next week you’ll have to let ’em go. Of course, the season closing date will ironically coincide with the time of year when sea bass can be found blitzing on the surface with bluefish and hardtails—something I have only ever experienced around Cape Cod. Point being, enjoy catching keeper sea bass while you can! Striper fishing remains at its best in the Canal, but in the next couple weeks as fish slowly begin to migrate south (if they haven’t already), the harbors and rivers will come back to life for a bit as baitfish continue to file out of the backwaters. Then, the fall run will be in full swing. I don’t know about you, but I’m looking forward to the dilemma of deciding whether to fish for bass in the dark, or rise bright and early to chase albies in the kayak. That’s a good problem to have. This weekend, exercise a bit of extra caution on the water. It’s one of the last busy weekends of the season, and you can bet there will be a ton of boats and kayaks on the water. Especially when chasing around albies, keep your head on a swivel and be respectful to other anglers around you. And most importantly, remember to have fun. I hope you all have a great Labor Day weekend. Thanks for reading, and may your lines be tight all weekend long. Sign up for our FREE Fishing Reports Today!

Vessel caught falsifying fishing logs,Google,"Montauk Fisherman on Trial for Conspiracy, Fraud Related to Fish Selling Scheme - 27 East"," The captain of the Montauk commercial fishing boat New Age is currently on trial in federal court for on felony fraud charges related to a scheme with the owners of Gosman's Fish Dock to sell fish caught illegally in violation of federal fisheries regulations.  The captain of the Montauk commercial fishing boat New Age is currently on trial in federal court for on felony fraud charges related to a scheme with the owners of Gosman's Fish Dock to sell fish caught illegally in violation of federal fisheries regulations.  A Montauk commercial fisherman is standing trial in federal court in Islip on felony charges of fraud and conspiracy related to the sale of what the government says was $850,000 worth of illegally caught fish sold through the well-known wholesale fish market Bob Gosman Co.  Federal prosecutors have charged Christoper Winkler, 63, with committing wire fraud and mail fraud by falsifying landing reports to under-report exactly how many fish he had caught and sold on hundreds of fishing trips between 2014 and 2017, and by conspiring with the Gosman’s wholesale company to conceal the source of the fish being sold at New York City wholesale markets.  Winkler’s vessel, the NEW AGE, is a relatively small, fire engine red, 45-foot steel-hulled commercial trawler that has fished out of Montauk for more than 30 years. But from May 2014 through at least February 2017, the federal indictment claims, Winkler and the Gosman’s wholesale company used shadow companies, set up like separate wholesalers but owned by Gosman’s, to bring fluke and black sea bass to the New York City market that had been caught in excess of federal- and state-managed quotas.  Winkler and the Gosmans were initially indicted in 2021 after a years-long investigation by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration that snared nearly two dozen fishermen from around Long Island for concealing the illegal landing and sale of fish caught in excess of set quotas.  During the trial, which is being held in the federal courthouse in Central Islip, federal prosecutors have called more than a dozen witnesses to testify against Winkler — including two members of the Gosman family, Bryan and Asa Gosman, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges related to the scheme in 2022 and agreed to pay a $50,000 fine in exchange for some of the same more serious charges that Winkler faces being dropped.  After the Gosmans pleaded guilty, a new expanded indictment was brought against Winkler, alleging a far broader scheme to sell illegally caught fish. What the federal prosecutors had initially said was about $250,000 worth of fish, the new indictment said was actually more than 200,000 pounds of illegally caught fluke and 20,000 pounds of sea bass, worth some $850,000 in total.  Federal and state commercial fisheries management relies on quotas for each species of fish a given vessel might catch, for each voyage or by the week. Fluke limits can be as low as 70 pounds of fish for a trip.  But in an inexact practice of trawling for fish with large nets towed through the ocean, fishermen often may catch many times their allowable quota for a specific species. The quota rules dictate that the fish be discarded, even though they often are already dead and could be worth tens of thousands of dollars to the fisherman — a practice that fishermen have long said is pointless, counter-productive and frustrating.  The indictment says that Winkler had falsified vessel trip reports that are supposed to detail exactly how many of each species of fish were caught and how many were discarded — information that regulators ostensibly would use to both enforce the law and inform future quota management. Winkler would only report landing the fish he was allowed to have but would land much more, the indictment claims.  The Gosmans, likewise, used falsified dealer reports to bring fish to market that should not have been able to be landed and sold.  The alleged scheme was profitable: From September 2015 to March 2017, the indictment says, the three dealers paid Winkler $620,000 for unreported and over-quota fluke and black sea bass.  An attorney for Winkler, Richard Levitt, said that he expects testimony at the trial to conclude later this week and Winkler’s fate to be handed over to the 12-person jury. Levitt declined to comment on the case against his client.  If convicted on all the charges, Winkler could face up to 20 years in prison. One fine body… We're happy you are enjoying our content.

Vessel caught falsifying fishing logs,Bing,Research finds log booms harmful to B.C. salmon and fish habitats," Two new studies are highlighting what researchers say is the harmful effect of log booms — floating structures that contain logs before processing — on fish habitats in B.C. rivers. A report from the Pacific Salmon Foundation and the B.C. Conservation Foundation (BCCF), led by the Cowichan Tribes, finds the presence of log booms at the mouth of the Cowichan River caused a 20 per cent reduction in survival rates for adult chinook salmon. Meanwhile, the lead author of a soon-to-be-published study from the University of B.C. and the Musqueam First Nation says that log booms in the Fraser River have a significant effect on nearby habitat, causing more soil to fall onto the riverbed and fewer invertebrates, which could be food for fish, to spawn. Researchers say the studies show the need for updated log-boom management practices to help fish thrive, something that is particularly urgent as the warming climate causes river levels to drop and makes life more difficult for salmon. The PSF and BCCF report studied salmon that had been tagged with transponders, with researchers monitoring how human activity affected their survival. Jamieson Atkinson, lead author of the BCCF study, said the log booms in the Cowichan River led more seals and sea lions to perch there — which, researchers suspect, caused more salmon to be eaten. The log booms also exacerbate the problem of low river flows, Atkinson said. ""When river discharge is low, it impacts the ability of fish to move into the river and then increases terminal mortality,"" he said. ""We need to reassess how log booms are stored in estuaries,"" he added. ""And if they run aground, and they're at mouths of rivers, the best option is to remove them into deeper water or out of the water entirely. ""To see it continuing into 2024, it's time that these changes are made,"" he added. Another study, set to be published in the Canadian Journal of Forest Research, looked at the impact of log booms on fish habitat in the Fraser River. It found that the area underneath booms can accumulate wood fibres and bark, and the booms could create oxygen problems for underwater creatures. UBC forestry professor Scott Hinch, who led that study, said the logs could leach chemicals and toxins that could harm the marine environment. ""They can change plant growth,"" he told CBC News. ""Because of the accumulation of material underneath [them], they can also change the sorts of invertebrates that are growing there. ""These, of course, are the food for the fish."" Hinch's study examined 19 sites on the Fraser River, from Pitt Meadows to the river's mouth.  It found that due to how frequently the booms would hit the riverbed because of the shallow depths at which they were floating, the soil under them would ""compact"" and compress under the repeated impact. ""I believe it was a four to five times higher abundance of invertebrates in our reference sites, compared to the log boom sites,"" he said, adding that the compacted soil and lack of sunlight meant that far fewer plants were growing on the riverbed — which meant invertebrates did not thrive. Hinch says both his study and the BCCF study pointed to the fact that water flows are affected by log booms — which could be a future area of research. The researchers say climate change and the changing river patterns that have come with drought conditions could prove challenging when it comes to mitigating the impact of log booms. Hinch says that best management practices state booms should not be tethered in river areas shallower than 12 metres, but few areas in the Lower Fraser River meet that criteria. ""You almost have to push them further out away from the shore,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, when you do that, you start getting into ship traffic and other navigational issues."" Hinch says one option could be ""fallowing"" the sites where log booms are stored after they're removed, in other words, not returning them to the same location, to allow for the area's natural recovery. Atkinson's study also suggests log mills could move their operations to locations that are less critical for salmon populations. Both Hinch and Atkinson agree that First Nations should take the lead in negotiating with forestry companies and the provincial government on the issue of log booms. B.C.'s Ministry of Forests said it had received the BCCF report and is reviewing its findings. Journalist Akshay Kulkarni is a journalist who has worked at CBC British Columbia since 2021.

Vessel caught falsifying fishing logs,Bing,"'Worrying about an explosion': Black smoke spreads for kilometers after three boats catch fire in Port Stanley, Ont.","  Thick, billowing black smoke could be seen for dozens of kilometres after three boats caught fire at a Port Stanley, Ont. marina Saturday afternoon.  Just before 1 p.m. a boat docked at the Kanagio Yacht Club caught fire, and with the wind blowing from the south, it quickly spread to the two vessels next to it.  “From what we understand, it may have been an electrical fire in the first boat that started it,” said Cpt. Todd Davies of Central Elgin Fire Rescue (CEFR).  Videos of the spectacular fire quickly spread on social media, and the owners of the boats started to head to the village when they were notified of what happened to their property.  Hubert Van Niekerk lost his boat when fire started on the vessel right next to his in the marina in Port Stanley, Ont. on June 15, 2024. (Brent Lale/CTV News London)“It's insured, and we're thinking about our next project boat, because I don't think this is going to buff out very well,” said Hubert Van Niekerk, trying to make light of the fact his boat is destroyed.  “This was a lot of blood, sweat, tears,” he added, looking at what is left of his boat.  He added the boat meant a lot to him, “It was a cheap enough boat to buy, but then spent the last four years fixing it up and put a whole new top on it and did all my own sewing. The biggest thing lost here is the sewing machine I purchased, which is a really good machine.”  Van Niekerk’s boat was the middle of the three that went up in flames.  There could have been a lot more damage if not for the quick thinking of Tyler Robertson, whose boat was docked just a few down from where the fire started.  Not much was left of three boats which caught fire in the marina in Port Stanley, Ont. on June 15, 2024. (Brent Lale/CTV News London)“The owner of the boat, yelled, ‘Fire’ and I was the closest,” said Robertson. “I grabbed my fire extinguisher and started coming down to this end, but by the time I got here, there's nothing you could do with fire extinguishers. It took us a minute to figure out what else to do.”  Robertson decided to quickly untie two boats which were adjacent to the third one, which started to catch fire.  “I thought, let's create a firebreak,” said Robertson, who untied two other boats and pushed them out away from the dock to contain the fire to the three boats.  “I just pushed them out. If they're in the middle of the river, they're not going to catch on fire. At that point it was close to where the hair is going to burn off my arms and I'm worrying about an explosion,” he said.

(Source: Jared Goodwin)  There were no injuries and CEFR says the Ontario Fire Marshal’s office has been contacted, but will not attend.  “They won't be investigating this,” said Davies. “Spills action was notified because of the fuel on board the vessels. The next step will be contacting insurance companies and getting the boats removed from the water.”  Van Niekerk was asked whether he’d be replacing this boat? He replied with quick-wit, “You want one? I’ve got one for sale if you want one?” The wife of a gunman in a fatal Toronto shooting says he believed the two victims were behind an alleged mortgage investment scheme that defrauded their family.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,Carnival Freedom cruise ship catches fire amid bad weather conditions," Menu The Carnival Freedom caught fire while sailing in the Bahamas on Saturday, March 23. The ship was heading to Freeport after canceling a call to Princess Cay due to bad weather conditions.  According to a release from Carnival Cruise Line, the fire broke out on the port side of the ship's exhaust funnel causing a portion of it to fall onto the deck. Soon after the fire broke out, the captain turned the ship around toward an area with heavy rain to maximize efforts of extinguishing the flames.  The captain made several announcements to guests and crew and advised everyone to stay away from the balconies and all open decks.  No injuries to guests were reported, but two members of the firefighting crew were treated for minor smoke inhalation. There were no operational issues with the ship's systems due to the fire, and all areas of the ship are fully functioning again, with the exception of the open decks.  No delays are expected to future voyages, and the ship plans to depart from Port Canaveral on Monday.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,The Crimes Behind the Seafood You Eat," Americans know little about how their seafood is sourced.
 Much of it comes from a vast fleet of Chinese ships.
 On board, human-rights abuses are rampant.
 China has invested heavily in an armada of far-flung fishing vessels, in part to extend its global influence. This maritime expansion has come at grave human cost.
 Daniel Aritonang graduated from high school in May, 2018, hoping to find a job. Short and lithe, he lived in the coastal village of Batu Lungun, Indonesia, where his father owned an auto shop. Aritonang spent his free time rebuilding engines in the shop, occasionally sneaking away to drag-race his blue Yamaha motorcycle on the village’s back roads. He had worked hard in school but was a bit of a class clown, always pranking the girls. “He was full of laughter and smiles,” his high-school math teacher, Leni Apriyunita, said. His mother brought homemade bread to his teachers’ houses, trying to help him get good grades and secure work; his father’s shop was failing, and the family needed money. But, when Aritonang finished high school, youth unemployment was above sixteen per cent. He considered joining the police academy, and applied for positions at nearby plastics and textile factories, but never got an offer, disappointing his parents. He wrote on Instagram, “I know I failed, but I keep trying to make them happy.” His childhood friend Hengki Anhar was also scrambling to find work. “They asked for my skills,” he said recently, of potential employers. “But, to be honest, I don’t have any.” At the time, many villagers who had taken jobs as deckhands on foreign fishing ships were returning with enough money to buy motorcycles and houses. Anhar suggested that he and Aritonang go to sea, too, and Aritonang agreed, saying, “As long as we’re together.” He intended to use the money to fix up his parents’ house or maybe to start a business. Firmandes Nugraha, another friend, worried that Aritonang was not cut out for hard labor. “We took a running test, and he was too easily exhausted,” he said. But Aritonang wouldn’t be dissuaded. A year later, in July, he and Anhar travelled to the port city of Tegal, and applied for work through a manning agency called PT Bahtera Agung Samudra. (The agency seems not to have a license to operate, according to government records, and did not respond to requests for comment.) They handed over their passports, copies of their birth certificates, and bank documents. At eighteen, Aritonang was still young enough that the agency required him to provide a letter of parental consent. He posted a picture of himself and other recruits, writing, “Just a bunch of common folk who hope for a successful and bright future.” This piece was published in collaboration with the Outlaw Ocean Project.
 For the next two months, Aritonang and Anhar waited in Tegal for a ship assignment. Aritonang asked Nugraha to borrow money for them, saying that the pair were struggling to buy food. Nugraha urged him to come home: “You don’t even know how to swim.” Aritonang refused. “There’s no other choice,” he wrote, in a text. Finally, on September 2, 2019, Aritonang and Anhar were flown to Busan, South Korea, to board what they thought would be a Korean ship. But when they got to the port they were told to climb aboard a Chinese vessel—a rusty, white-and-red-keeled squid ship called the Zhen Fa 7. That day, the ship set out across the Pacific.
 Aritonang had just joined what may be the largest maritime operation the world has ever known.
 In the past few decades, partly in an effort to project its influence abroad, China has dramatically expanded its distant-water fishing fleet. Chinese firms now own or operate terminals in ninety-five foreign ports. China estimates that it has twenty-seven hundred distant-water fishing ships, though this figure does not include vessels in contested waters; public records and satellite imaging suggest that the fleet may be closer to sixty-five hundred ships. (The U.S. and the E.U., by contrast, have fewer than three hundred distant-water fishing vessels each.) Some ships that appear to be fishing vessels press territorial claims in contested waters, including in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. “This may look like a fishing fleet, but, in certain places, it’s also serving military purposes,” Ian Ralby, who runs I.R. Consilium, a maritime-security firm, told me. China’s preëminence at sea has come at a cost. The country is largely unresponsive to international laws, and its fleet is the worst perpetrator of illegal fishing in the world, helping drive species to the brink of extinction. Its ships are also rife with labor trafficking, debt bondage, violence, criminal neglect, and death. “The human-rights abuses on these ships are happening on an industrial and global scale,” Steve Trent, the C.E.O. of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said. It took a little more than three months for the Zhen Fa 7 to cross the ocean and anchor near the Galápagos Islands. A squid ship is a bustling, bright, messy place. The scene on deck looks like a mechanic’s garage where an oil change has gone terribly wrong. Scores of fishing lines extend into the water, each bearing specialized hooks operated by automated reels. When they pull a squid on board, it squirts warm, viscous ink, which coats the walls and floors. Deep-sea squid have high levels of ammonia, which they use for buoyancy, and a smell hangs in the air. The hardest labor generally happens at night, from 5 P.M. until 7 A.M. Hundreds of bowling-ball-size light bulbs hang on racks on both sides of the vessel, enticing the squid up from the depths. The blinding glow of the bulbs, visible more than a hundred miles away, makes the surrounding blackness feel otherworldly. “Our minds got tested,” Anhar said. The captain’s quarters were on the uppermost deck; the Chinese officers slept on the level below him, and the Chinese deckhands under that. The Indonesian workers occupied the bowels of the ship. Aritonang and Anhar lived in cramped cabins with bunk beds. Clotheslines of drying socks and towels lined the walls, and beer bottles littered the floor. The Indonesians were paid about three thousand dollars a year, plus a twenty-dollar bonus for every ton of squid caught. Once a week, a list of each man’s catch was posted in the mess hall to encourage the crew to work harder. Sometimes the officers patted the Indonesian deckhands on their heads, as though they were children. When angry, they insulted or struck them. The foreman slapped and punched workers for mistakes. “It’s like we don’t have any dignity,” Anhar said. The ship was rarely near enough to land to get cell reception, and, in any case, most deckhands didn’t have phones that would work abroad. Chinese crew members were occasionally allowed to use a satellite phone on the ship’s bridge. But when Aritonang and other Indonesians asked to call home the captain refused. After a couple of weeks on board, a deckhand named Rahman Finando got up the nerve to ask whether he could go home. The captain said no. A few days later, another deckhand, Mangihut Mejawati, found a group of Chinese officers and deckhands beating Finando, to punish him for asking to leave. “They beat his whole body and stepped on him,” Mejawati said. The other deckhands yelled for them to stop, and several jumped into the fray. Eventually, the violence ended, but the deckhands remained trapped on the ship. Mejawati told me, “It’s like we’re in a cage.” Almost a hundred years before Columbus, China dominated the seas. In the fifteenth century, China’s emperor dispatched a fleet of “treasure ships” that included warships, transports for cavalry horses, and merchant vessels carrying silk and porcelain to voyage around the Indian Ocean. They were some of the largest wooden ships ever built, with innovations like balanced rudders and bulwarked compartments that predated European technology by centuries. The armada’s size was not surpassed until the navies of the First World War. But during the Ming dynasty political instability led China to turn inward. By the mid-sixteenth century, sailing on a multi-masted ship had become a crime. In docking its fleet, China lost its global preëminence. As Louise Levathes, the author of “When China Ruled the Seas,” told me, “The period of China’s greatest outward expansion was followed by the period of its greatest isolation.” For most of the twentieth century, distant-water fishing—much of which takes place on the high seas—was dominated by the Soviet Union, Japan, and Spain. But the collapse of the U.S.S.R., coupled with expanding environmental and labor regulations, caused these fleets to shrink. Since the sixties, though, there have been advances in refrigeration, satellite technology, engine efficiency, and radar. Vessels can now stay at sea for more than two years without returning to land. As a result, global seafood consumption has risen fivefold. Squid fishing, or jigging, in particular, has grown with American appetites. Until the early seventies, Americans consumed squid in tiny amounts, mostly at niche restaurants on the coasts. But as overfishing depleted fish stocks the federal government encouraged fishermen to shift their focus to squid, whose stocks were still robust. In 1974, a business-school student named Paul Kalikstein published a master’s thesis asserting that Americans would prefer squid if it were breaded and fried. Promoters suggested calling it “calamari,” the Italian word, which made it sound more like a gourmet dish. (“Squid” is thought to be a sailors’ variant of “squirt,” a reference to squid ink.) By the nineties, chain restaurants across the Midwest were serving squid. Today, Americans eat a hundred thousand tons a year. China launched its first distant-water fishing fleet in 1985, when a state-owned company called the China National Fisheries Corporation dispatched thirteen trawlers to the coast of Guinea-Bissau. China had been fishing its own coastal waters aggressively. Since the sixties, its seafood biomass has dropped by ninety per cent. Zhang Yanxi, the general manager of the company, argued that joining “the ranks of the world’s offshore fisheries powers” would make the country money, create jobs, feed its population, and safeguard its maritime rights. The government held a grand farewell ceremony for the launch of the first ships, with more than a thousand attendees, including Communist Party élites. A promotional video described the crew as “two hundred and twenty-three brave pioneers cutting through the waves.” Sign up to receive the best of The New Yorker, every day, in your in-box, plus occasional news alerts.
 Since then, China has invested heavily in its fleet. The country now catches more than five billion pounds of seafood a year through distant-water fishing, the biggest portion of it squid. China’s seafood industry, which is estimated to be worth more than thirty-five billion dollars, accounts for a fifth of the international trade, and has helped create fifteen million jobs. The Chinese state owns much of the industry—including some twenty per cent of its squid ships—and oversees the rest through the Overseas Fisheries Association. Today, the nation consumes more than a third of the world’s fish. China’s fleet has also expanded the government’s international influence. The country has built scores of ports as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure program that has, at times, made it the largest financier of development in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia. These ports allow it to shirk taxes and avoid meddling inspectors. The investments also buy its government influence. In 2007, China loaned Sri Lanka more than three hundred million dollars to pay for the construction of a port. (A Chinese state-owned company built it.) In 2017, Sri Lanka, on the verge of defaulting on the loan, was forced to strike a deal granting China control over the port and its environs for ninety-nine years. Military analysts believe that China uses its fleet for surveillance. In 2017, the country passed a law requiring private citizens and businesses to support Chinese intelligence efforts. Ports employ a digital logistics platform called Logink, which tracks the movement of ships and goods in the surrounding area—including, possibly, American military cargo. Michael Wessel, a member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, told me, “This is really dangerous information for the U.S. to be handing over.” (The Chinese Communist Party has dismissed these concerns, saying, “It is no secret that the U.S. has become increasingly paranoid about anything related to China.”) China also pushes its fleet into contested waters. “China likely believes that, in time, the presence of its distant-water fleet will convert into some degree of sovereign control over those waters,” Ralby, the maritime-security specialist, told me. Some of its ships are disguised as fishing vessels but actually form what experts call a “maritime militia.” According to research collected by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Chinese government pays the owners of some of these ships forty-five hundred dollars a day to remain in contested areas for most of the year. Satellite data show that, last year, several dozen ships illegally fished in Taiwanese waters and that there were two hundred ships in disputed portions of the South China Sea. The ships help execute what a recent Congressional Research Service study called “ ‘gray zone’ operations that use coercion short of war.” They escort Chinese oil-and-gas survey vessels, deliver supplies, and obstruct foreign ships. Sometimes these vessels are called into action. In December, 2018, the Filipino government began to repair a runway and build a beaching ramp on Thitu Island, a piece of land claimed by both the Philippines and China. More than ninety Chinese ships amassed along its coast, delaying the construction. In 2019, a Chinese vessel rammed and sank a Filipino boat anchored at Reed Bank, a disputed region in the South China Sea that is rich in oil reserves. Zhou Bo, a retired Chinese senior colonel, recently warned that these sorts of clashes could spark a war between the U.S. and China. (The Chinese government declined to comment on these matters. But Mao Ning, a spokesperson for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has previously defended her country’s right to uphold “China’s territorial sovereignty and maritime order.”) Greg Poling, a senior fellow at C.S.I.S., noted that taking ownership of contested waters is part of the same project as assuming control of Taiwan. “The goal with these fishing ships is to reclaim ‘lost territory’ and restore China’s former glory,” he said. China’s distant-water fleet is opaque. The country divulges little information about its vessels, and some stay at sea for more than a year at a time, making them difficult to inspect. I spent the past four years, backed by a team of investigators working for a journalism nonprofit I run called the Outlaw Ocean Project, visiting the fleet’s ships in their largest fishing grounds: near the Galápagos Islands; near the Falkland Islands; off the coast of the Gambia; and in the Sea of Japan, near the Korean Peninsula. When permitted, I boarded vessels to talk to the crew or pulled alongside them to interview officers by radio. In many instances, the Chinese ships got spooked, pulled up their gear, and fled. When this happened, I trailed them in a skiff to get close enough to throw aboard plastic bottles weighed down with rice, containing a pen, cigarettes, hard candy, and interview questions. On several occasions, deckhands wrote replies, providing phone numbers for family back home, and then threw the bottles back into the water. The reporting included interviews with their family members, and with two dozen additional crew members. China bolsters its fleet with more than seven billion dollars a year in subsidies, as well as with logistical, security, and intelligence support. For instance, it sends vessels updates on the size and location of the world’s major squid colonies, allowing the ships to coördinate their fishing. In 2022, I watched about two hundred and sixty ships jigging a patch of sea west of the Galápagos. The armada suddenly raised anchor and, in near simultaneity, moved a hundred miles to the southeast. Ted Schmitt, the director of Skylight, a maritime-monitoring program, told me that this is unusual: “Fishing vessels from most other countries wouldn’t work together on this scale.” In July of that year, I pulled alongside the Zhe Pu Yuan 98, a squid ship that doubles as a floating hospital to treat deckhands without bringing them to shore. “When workers are sick, they will come to our ship,” the captain told me, by radio. The boat typically carried a doctor and maintained an operating room, a machine for running blood tests, and videoconferencing capabilities for consulting with doctors back in China. Its predecessor had treated more than three hundred people in the previous five years. In February, 2022, I went with the conservation group Sea Shepherd and a documentary filmmaker named Ed Ou, who also translated on the trip, to the high seas near the Falkland Islands, and boarded a Chinese squid jigger there. The captain gave permission for me and a couple of my team members to roam freely as long as I didn’t name his vessel. He remained on the bridge but had an officer shadow me wherever I went. The mood on the ship felt like that of a watery purgatory. The crew was made up of thirty-one men; their teeth were yellowed from chain-smoking, their skin sallow, their hands torn and spongy from sharp gear and perpetual wetness. The scene recalled an observation of the Scythian philosopher Anacharsis, who divided people into three categories: the living, the dead, and those at sea. When squid latched on to a line, an automated reel flipped them onto a metal rack. Deckhands then tossed them into plastic baskets for sorting. The baskets often overflowed, and the floor filled shin-deep with squid. The squid became translucent in their final moments, sometimes hissing or coughing. (Their stink and stain are virtually impossible to wash from clothes. Sometimes crew members tie their dirty garments into a rope, up to twenty feet long, and drag it for hours in the water behind the ship.) Below deck, crew members weighed, sorted, and packed the squid for freezing. They prepared bait by carving squid up, separating the tongues from inside the beaks. In the galley, the cook noted that his ship had no fresh fruits or vegetables and asked whether we might be able to donate some from our ship. We spoke to two Chinese deckhands who were wearing bright-orange life vests. Neither wanted his name used, for fear of retaliation. One man was twenty-­eight, the other eighteen. It was their first time at sea, and they had signed two-year contracts. They earned about ten thousand dollars a year, but, for every day taken off work because of sickness or injury, they were docked two days’ pay. The older deckhand recounted watching a fishing weight injure another crew member’s arm. At one point, the officer following us was called away. The older deckhand then said that many of the crew were being held there against their will. “It’s like being isolated from the world and far from modern life,” he said. “Many of us had our documents taken. They won’t give them back. Can we ask you to help us?” He added, “It’s impossible to be happy, because we work many hours every day. We don’t want to be here, but we are forced to stay.” He estimated that eighty per cent of the other men would leave if they were allowed. Looking nervous, the younger deckhand waved us into a dark hallway. He began typing on his cell phone. “I can’t disclose too much right now given I still need to work on the vessel, if I give too much information it might potentially create issues on board,” he wrote. He gave me a phone number for his family and asked me to contact them. “Can you get us to the embassy in Argentina?” he asked. Just then, my minder rounded the corner, and the deckhand walked away. Minutes later, my team members and I were ushered off the ship. When I returned to shore, I contacted his family. “My heart really aches,” his older sister, a math teacher in Fujian, said, after hearing of her brother’s situation. Her family had disagreed with his decision to go to sea, but he was persistent. She hadn’t known that he was being held captive, and felt helpless to free him. “He’s really too young,” she said. “And now there is nothing we can do, because he’s so far away.” In June, 2020, the Zhen Fa 7 travelled to a pocket of ocean between the Galápagos and mainland Ecuador. The ship was owned by Rongcheng Wangdao Deep-Sea Aquatic Products, a midsize company based in Shandong. On board, Aritonang had slowly got used to his new life. The captain found out that he had mechanical experience and moved him to the engine room, where the work was slightly less taxing. For meals, the cook prepared pots of rice mixed with bits of fish. The Indonesians were each issued two boxes of instant noodles a week. If they wanted any other food—or coffee, alcohol, or cigarettes—the cost could be deducted from their salaries. Crew photos show deckhands posing with their catch and gathering for beers to celebrate. One of Aritonang’s friends on board was named Heri Kusmanto. “When we boarded the ship in the first weeks, Heri was a lively person,” Mejawati said. “He chatted, sang, and joked with all of us.” Kusmanto’s job was to carry hundred-pound baskets of squid down to the refrigerated hold. He sometimes made mistakes, and that earned him beatings. “He did not dare fight back,” a deckhand named Fikran told me. “He would just stay quiet and stand still.” The ship’s cook often struck Kusmanto, so he avoided him by eating plain white rice in the kitchen when the cook wasn’t around. Kusmanto soon got sick. He lost his appetite and stopped speaking, communicating mostly through gestures. “He was like a toddler,” Mejawati said. Then Kusmanto’s legs and feet swelled and started to ache. Kusmanto seemed to be suffering from beriberi, a disease caused by a deficiency of Vitamin B1, or thiamine. Its name derives from a Sinhalese word, beri, meaning “weak” or “I cannot.” It is often caused by a diet consisting mainly of white rice, instant noodles, or wheat flour. Symptoms include tingling, burning, numbness, difficulty breathing, lethargy, chest pain, dizziness, confusion, and severe swelling. Like scurvy, beriberi was common among nineteenth-century sailors. It also has a history in prisons, asylums, and migrant camps. If untreated, it can be fatal. Beriberi is becoming prevalent on Chinese vessels in part because ships stay so long at sea, a trend facilitated by transshipment, which allows vessels to offload their catch to refrigerated carriers without returning to shore. Chinese ships typically stock rice and instant noodles for extended trips, because they are cheap and slow to spoil. But the body requires more B1 when carbohydrates are consumed in large amounts and during periods of intense exertion. Ship cooks also mix rice or noodles with raw or fermented fish, and supplement meals with coffee and tea, all of which are high in thiaminase, which destroys B1, exacerbating the issue. Beriberi is often an indication of conditions of captivity, because it is avoidable and easily reversed. Some countries (though not China) mandate that rice and flour be supplemented with B1. The illness can also be treated with vitamins, and when B1 is administered intravenously patients typically recover within twenty-four hours. But few Chinese ships seem to carry B1 supplements. In many cases, captains refuse to bring sick crew members to shore, likely because the process would entail losing time and incurring labor costs. Swells can make it dangerous for large ships to get close to each other in order to transfer crew members. One video I reviewed shows a man being put inside a fishing net and sent hundreds of feet along a zip line, several stories above the open ocean, to get on another ship. My team and I found two dozen cases of workers on Chinese vessels between 2013 and 2021 who suffered from symptoms associated with beriberi; at least fifteen died. Victor Weedn, a forensic pathologist in Washington, D.C., told me that allowing workers to die from beriberi would, in the U.S., constitute criminal neglect. “Slow-motion murder is still murder,” he said. The contract typically used by Kusmanto’s manning agency stipulated heavy financial penalties for workers and their families if they quit prematurely. It also allowed the company to take workers’ identity papers, including their passports, during the recruitment process, and to keep the documents if they failed to pay a fine for leaving early—provisions that violate laws in the U.S. and Indonesia. Still, as Kusmanto’s condition worsened, his Indonesian crewmates asked whether he could go home. The captain refused. (Rongcheng Wangdao denied wrongdoing. The captains of Chinese ships in this piece could not be identified for comment. A spokesman for the manning agency blamed Kusmanto for his illness, writing, “When on the ship, he didn’t want to take a shower, he didn’t want to eat, and he only ate instant noodles.”) The ship may have been fishing illegally at the time, possibly complicating Kusmanto’s situation. During this period, according to an unpublished intelligence report compiled by the U.S. government, the Zhen Fa 7 turned off its location transponder several times, in violation of Chinese law. This generally occurred when the ship was close to Ecuadorian and Peruvian waters; captains often go dark to fish in other countries’ waters, like those of Ecuador, where Chinese ships are typically forbidden.
 On June 21st, the ship disappeared for eight days, between Peruvian and Ecuadorian waters.
 On July 28th, it disappeared for fifteen days, near the Galápagos.
 On August 14th, it disappeared again, near Ecuadorian waters.
 “Short of catching them in the act, this is as close as you can get to firm evidence,” Michael J. Fitzpatrick, the U.S. Ambassador to Ecuador, told me. (Rongcheng Wangdao’s vessels have been known to fish in unauthorized areas; one of the Zhen Fa 7’s sister ships was fined for unlawfully entering Peruvian waters in 2017, and another was found illicitly fishing off the coast of North Korea. The company declined to comment on this matter.) Transferring Kusmanto to another vessel would have required disclosing the Zhen Fa 7’s location, which might have been incriminating. By early August, Kusmanto had become disoriented. Other deckhands demanded that he be given medical attention. Eventually, the captain relented, and transferred him to another ship, which carried him to port in Lima. He was taken to a hospital, where he recovered; afterward, he was flown home. (Kusmanto could not be reached for comment.) Meanwhile, the rest of the crew, which had by then been at sea for a year, felt a growing sense of isolation. “They had initially told us that we would be sailing for eight months, and then they would land the ship,” Anhar said. “The fact was we never landed anywhere.” China does more illegal fishing than any other country, according to the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. Operating on the high seas is expensive, and there is virtually no law-enforcement presence—which encourages fishing in forbidden regions and using prohibited techniques to gain a competitive advantage. Aggressive fishing comes at an environmental cost. A third of the world’s stocks are overfished. Squid stocks, once robust, have declined dramatically. More than thirty countries, including China, have banned shark finning, but the practice persists. Chinese ships often catch hammerhead, oceanic whitetip, and blue sharks so that their fins can be used in shark-fin soup. In 2017, Ecuadorian authorities discovered at least six thousand illegally caught sharks on board a single reefer. Other marine species are being decimated, too. Vessels fishing for totoaba, a large fish whose swim bladder is highly prized in Chinese medicine, use nets that inadvertently entangle and drown vaquita porpoises, which live only in Mexico’s Sea of Cortez. Researchers estimate that, as a result, there are now only some ten vaquitas left in existence. China has the world’s largest fleet of bottom trawlers, which drag nets across the seafloor, levelling coral reefs. Marine sediment stores large amounts of carbon, and, according to a recent study in Nature, bottom trawlers release almost a billion and a half tons of carbon dioxide each year—as much as that released by the entire aviation industry. China’s illicit fishing practices also rob poorer countries of their own resources. Off the coast of West Africa, where China maintains a fleet of hundreds of ships, illegal fishing has been estimated to cost the region more than nine billion dollars a year. The world’s largest concentration of illegal fishing ships may be a fleet of Chinese squidders in North Korean waters. In 2017, in response to North Korea’s nuclear- and ballistic-missile tests, the United Nations Security Council, with apparent backing from China, imposed sanctions intended to deprive Kim Jong Un’s government of foreign currency, in part by blocking it from selling fishing rights, a major source of income. But, according to the U.N., Pyongyang has continued to earn foreign currency—a hundred and twenty million dollars in 2018 alone—by granting illicit rights, predominantly to Chinese fishermen. An advertisement on the Chinese Web site Zhihu offers permits issued by the North Korean military for “no risk high yield” fishing with no catch limits: “Looking forward to a win-win cooperation.” China seems unable or unwilling to enforce sanctions on its ally. Chinese boats have contributed to a decline in the region’s squid stock; catches are down by roughly seventy per cent since 2003. Local fishermen have been unable to compete. “We will be ruined,” Haesoo Kim, the leader of an association of South Korean fishermen on Ulleung Island, which I visited in May, 2019, said. North Korean fishing captains have been forced to head farther from shore, where their ships get caught in storms or succumb to engine failure, and crew members face starvation, freezing temperatures, and drowning. Roughly a hundred small North Korean fishing boats wash up on Japanese shores annually, some of them carrying the corpses of fishermen. Chinese boats in these waters are also known for ramming patrol vessels. In 2016, Chinese fishermen rammed and sank a South Korean cutter in the Yellow Sea. In another incident, the South Korean Coast Guard opened fire on more than two dozen Chinese ships that rushed at its vessels. In 2019, I went with a South Korean squid ship to the sea border between North Korea and South Korea. It didn’t take us long to find a convoy of Chinese squidders headed into North Korean waters. We fell in alongside them and launched a drone to capture their identification numbers. One of the Chinese captains blared his horn and flashed his lights—warning signs in maritime protocol. Since we were in South Korean waters and at a legal distance, our captain stayed his course. The Chinese captain then abruptly cut toward us, on a collision trajectory. Our captain veered away when the Chinese vessel was only thirty feet off. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told me that “China has consistently and conscientiously enforced the resolutions of the Security Council relating to North Korea,” and added that the country has “consistently punished” illegal fishing. But the Ministry neither admitted nor denied that China sends boats into North Korean waters. In 2020, the nonprofit Global Fishing Watch used satellite data to reveal that hundreds of Chinese squid ships were routinely fishing in North Korean waters. By 2022, China had cut down this illegal armada by seventy-five per cent from its peak. Still, in unregulated waters, the hours worked by the fleet have increased, and the size of its catch has only grown. Shortly after New Year’s Day, 2021, the Zhen Fa 7 rounded the tip of South America and stopped briefly in Chilean waters, close enough to shore to get cell-phone reception. Aritonang went to the bridge and, through pantomime and broken English, asked one of the officers whether he could borrow his phone. The officer indicated that it would cost him, rubbing his forefinger and thumb together. Aritonang ran below deck, sold some of his cigarettes and snacks to other deckhands, borrowed whatever money he could, and came back with the equivalent of about thirteen dollars, which bought him five minutes. He dialled his parents’ house, and his mother answered, excited to hear his voice. He told her that he would be home by May and asked to speak to his father. “He’s resting,” she told him. In fact, he had died of a heart attack several days earlier, but Aritonang’s mother didn’t want to upset her son while he was at sea. She later told their pastor that she was looking forward to Aritonang’s return. “He wants to build a house for us,” she said. Soon afterward, the ship dropped anchor in the Blue Hole, an area near the Falkland Islands, where ongoing territorial disputes between the U.K. and Argentina provide a gap in maritime enforcement that ships can exploit. Aritonang grew homesick, staying in his room and eating mostly instant noodles. “He seemed to become sad and tired,” Fikran said. That January, Aritonang fell ill with beriberi. The whites of his eyes turned yellow, and his legs became swollen. “Daniel was in pretty bad shape,” Anhar told me. The captain refused to get him medical attention. “There was still a lot of squid,” Anhar said. “We were in the middle of an operation.” In February, the crew unloaded their catch onto a reefer that carried it to Mauritius. But, for reasons that remain unclear, the captain refused to send Aritonang to shore as well. Eventually, Aritonang could no longer walk. The Indonesian crew went to the bridge again and confronted the captain, threatening to strike if he didn’t get Aritonang medical help. “We were all against the captain,” Anhar said. Finally, the captain acquiesced, and, on March 2nd, transferred Aritonang to a fuel tanker, the Marlin, which agreed to carry him to Montevideo, Uruguay. The Marlin’s crew brought him to a service area off the coast, where a skiff picked him up and took him to the port. A maritime agency representing Rongcheng Wangdao in Uruguay called a local hospital, and ambulance workers took him there. Jesica Reyes, who is thirty-six, is one of the few interpreters of Indonesian in Montevideo. She taught herself the language while working at an Internet café that was popular among Indonesian crews; they called her Mbak, meaning “Miss” or “big sister.” From 2013 to 2021, fishing ships, most of them Chinese, disembarked a dead body in Montevideo roughly every month and a half. Over a recent dinner, Reyes told me about hundreds of deckhands in need whom she had assisted. She described one deckhand who died from a tooth infection because his captain wouldn’t bring him to shore. She told me of another ailing deckhand whose agency neglected to take him to a hospital, keeping him in a hotel room while his condition deteriorated; he eventually died. On March, 7, 2021, Reyes was asked by the maritime agency to go to the emergency room to help doctors communicate with Aritonang; she was told that he had a stomach ache. When he arrived at the hospital, however, his whole body was swollen, and she could see bruises around his eyes and neck. He whispered to her that he had been tied by the neck. (Other deckhands later told me that they hadn’t seen this happen, and were unsure when he sustained the injuries.) Reyes called the maritime agency and said, “If this is a stomach ache . . . You’re not looking at this young man. He is all messed up!” She took photographs of his condition, before doctors asked her to stop, because she was alarmed. In the emergency room, physicians administered intravenous fluids. Aritonang, crying and shaking, asked Reyes, “Where are my friends?” He whispered, “I’m scared.” Aritonang was pronounced dead the following morning. “I was angry,” Reyes told me. The deckhands I reached were furious. Mejawati said, “We really hope that, if it’s possible, the captain and all the supervisors can be captured, charged, or jailed.” Anhar, Aritonang’s best friend, found out about his death only after disembarking from the Zhen Fa 7 in Singapore, that May. “We were devastated,” he said, of the crew members. When we reached him, he was still carrying a suitcase full of Aritonang’s clothes that he’d promised to take home for him. Fishing is one of the world’s deadliest jobs—a recent study estimates that more than a hundred thousand workers die every year—and Chinese ships are among the most brutal. Recruiters often target desperate men in inland China and in poor countries. “If you are in debt, your family has shunned you, you don’t want to be looked down on, turn off your phone and stay far away from land,” an online advertisement in China reads. Some recruits are lured with promises of lucrative contracts, according to court documents and investigations by Chinese news outlets, only to discover that they incur a series of fees—sometimes amounting to more than a month’s wages—to cover expenses such as travel, job training, crew certifications, and protective workwear. Often, workers pay these fees by taking out loans from the manning agencies, creating a form of debt bondage. Companies confiscate passports and extract fines for leaving jobs, further trapping workers. And even those who are willing to risk penalties are sometimes in essence held captive on ships. For a 2022 report, the Environmental Justice Foundation interviewed more than a hundred Indonesian crew members and found that roughly ninety-seven per cent had their documents confiscated or experienced debt bondage. Occasionally, workers in these conditions manage to alert authorities. In 2014, twenty-eight African workers disembarked from a Chinese squidder called the Jia De 1, which was anchored in Montevideo, and several complained of beatings on board and showed shackle marks on their ankles. Fifteen crew members were hospitalized. (The company that owned the ship did not respond to requests for comment.) In 2020, several Indonesian deckhands reportedly complained about severe beatings at sea and the presence of a man’s body in one of the ship’s freezers. An autopsy revealed that the man had sustained bruises, scarring, and a spinal injury. Indonesian authorities sentenced several manning-agency executives to more than a year in prison for labor trafficking. (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) In China, these labor abuses are an open secret. A diary kept by one Chinese deckhand offers an unusually detailed glimpse into this world. In May, 2013, the deckhand paid a two-hundred-dollar recruitment fee to a manning agency, which dispatched him to a ship called the Jin Han Yu 4879. The crew were told that their first ten days or so on board would be a trial period, after which they could leave, but the ship stayed at sea for a hundred and two days. “You are slaves to work anytime and anywhere,” the deckhand wrote in his diary. Officers were served meat at mealtimes, he said, but deckhands got only bones. “The bell rings, you must be up, whether it is day, night, early morning, no matter how strong the wind, how heavy the rain, there are no Sundays and holidays.” (The company that owns the ship did not respond to requests for comment.) The broader public in China was forced to reckon with the conditions on ships when the crew of a squid jigger called the Lu Rong Yu 2682 mutinied, in 2011. The captain, Li Chengquan, was a “big, tall, and bad-tempered man” who, according to a deckhand, gave a black eye to a worker who angered him. Rumors began circulating that the seven-thousand-dollar annual salary that they had been promised was not guaranteed. Instead, they would earn about four cents per pound of squid caught—which would amount to far less. Nine crew members took the captain hostage. In the next five weeks, the ship’s crew devolved into warring factions. Men disappeared at night, a crew member was tied up and tossed overboard, and someone sabotaged a valve on the ship, which started letting water in. The crew eventually managed to restore the ship’s communications system and transmit a distress signal, drawing two Chinese fishing vessels to their aid. Only eleven of the original thirty-three men made it back to shore. The lead mutineer and the ship’s captain were sentenced to death by the Chinese government. (The company that owns the ship did not respond to requests for comment.) Labor trafficking has also been documented on American, South Korean, and Thai boats. But China’s fleet is arguably the worst offender, and it has done little to curb violations. Between 2018 and 2022, my team found, China gave more than seventeen million dollars in subsidies to companies where at least fifty ships seem to have engaged in fishing crimes or had deaths or injuries on board—some of which were likely the result of unsafe labor conditions. (The government declined to comment on this matter, but Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently said that the fleet operates “in accordance with laws and regulations,” and accused the U.S. of politicizing “issues that are about fisheries in the name of environmental protection and human rights.”) In the past few years, China has made a number of reforms, but they seem aimed more at quelling dissent than at holding companies accountable. In 2017, after a Filipino worker died in a knife fight with some of his Chinese crewmates, the Chinese government created a Communist Party branch in Chimbote, Peru—the first for fishing workers—intended to bolster their “spiritual sustenance.” Local police in some Chinese cities have begun using satellite video links to connect to the bridges of some Chinese vessels. In 2020, when Chinese crew members on a ship near Peru went on strike, the company contacted the local police, who explained to the workers that they could come ashore in Peru and fly back to China, but they would have to pay for the plane tickets. “Wouldn’t it feel like losing out if you resigned now?” a police officer asked. The men returned to work. As I reported on these ships, stories of violence and captivity surfaced even when I wasn’t looking for them. This year, I received a video from 2020 in which two Filipino crew members said that they were ill but were being prevented from leaving their ship. “Please rescue us,” one pleaded. “We are already sick here. The captain won’t send us to the hospital.” Three deckhands died that summer; at least one of their bodies was thrown overboard. (The manning agency that placed these workers on the ship, PT Puncak Jaya Samudra, did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did the company that owns the ship.) On a trip to Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2020, I met a half-dozen young men who told me that, in 2019, a young deckhand named Fadhil died on their ship because the officers had refused to bring him to shore. “He was begging to return home, but he was not allowed,” Ramadhan Sugandhi, a deckhand, said. (The ship-owning company did not respond to requests for comment, nor did his manning agency, PT Shafar Abadi Indonesia.) This past June, a bottle washed ashore near Maldonado, Uruguay, containing what appeared to be a message from a distressed Chinese deckhand. “Hello, I am a crew member of the ship Lu Qing Yuan Yu 765, and I was locked up by the company,” it read. “When you see this paper, please help me call the police! S.O.S. S.O.S.” (The owner of the ship, Qingdao Songhai Fishery, said that the claims were fabricated by crew members.) Reyes, the Indonesian translator, put me in touch with Rafly Maulana Sadad, an Indonesian who, while working on the Lu Rong Yuan Yu 978 two years ago, fell down a flight of stairs and broke his back. He immediately went back to work pulling nets, then fainted, and woke up in bed. The captain refused to take him to shore, and he spent the next five months on the ship, his condition worsening. Sadad’s friends helped him eat and bathe, but he was disoriented and often lay in a pool of his own urine. “I was having difficulty speaking,” Sadad told me last year. “I felt like I’d had a stroke or something. I couldn’t really understand anything.” In August, 2021, the captain dropped Sadad off in Montevideo, and he spent nine days in the hospital, before being flown home. (Requests for comment from Rongcheng Rongyuan, which owns the ship Sadad worked on, and PT Abadi Mandiri International, his manning agency, went unanswered.) Sadad spoke to me from Indonesia, where he could walk only with crutches. “It was a very bitter life experience,” he said. Like the boats that supply them, Chinese processing plants rely on forced labor. For the past thirty years, the North Korean government has required citizens to work in factories in Russia and China, and to put ninety per cent of their earnings—amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars—into accounts controlled by the state. Laborers are often subjected to heavy monitoring and strictly limited in their movements. U.N. sanctions ban such uses of North Korean workers, but, according to Chinese government estimates, last year as many as eighty thousand North Korean workers were living in one city in northeastern China alone. According to a report by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, at least four hundred and fifty of them were working in seafood plants. The Chinese government has largely scrubbed references to these workers from the Internet. But, using the search term “North Korean beauties,” my team and I found several videos on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, that appear to show female seafood-plant workers, most posted by gawking male employees. One Chinese commenter observed that the women “have a strong sense of national identity and are self-disciplined!” Another argued, however, that the workers have no choice but to obey orders, or “their family members will suffer.” In the past decade, China has also overseen a crackdown on Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, a region in northwestern China, setting up mass detention centers and forcing detainees to work in cotton fields, on tomato farms, and in polysilicon factories. More recently, in an effort to disrupt Uyghur communities and find cheap labor for major industries, the government has relocated millions of Uyghurs to work for companies across the country. Workers are often supervised by security guards, in dorms surrounded by barbed wire. By searching company newsletters, annual reports, and state-media stories, my team and I found that, in the past five years, thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have been sent to work in seafood-processing plants. Some are subjected to “patriotic education”; in a 2021 article, local Party officials said that members of minority groups working at one seafood plant were a “typical big family” and were learning to deepen their “education of ethnic unity.” Laura Murphy, a professor at Sheffield Hallam University, in the U.K., told me, “This is all part of the project to erase Uyghur culture, identities, religion, and, most certainly, their politics. The goal is the complete transformation of the entire community.” (Chinese officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Uyghur and North Korean forced labor in the nation’s seafood-processing industry.) The U.S. has strict laws forbidding the importation of goods produced with North Korean or Uyghur labor. The use of such workers in other industries—for example, in solar-panel manufacturing—has been documented in recent years, and the U.S. has confiscated a billion dollars’ worth of imported products as a result. We found, however, that companies employing Uyghurs and North Koreans have recently exported at least forty-seven thousand tons of seafood, including some seventeen per cent of all squid sent to the U.S. Shipments went to dozens of American importers, including ones that supply military bases and public-school cafeterias. “These revelations pose a very serious problem for the entire seafood industry,” Martina Vandenberg, the founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, told me. China does not welcome reporting on this industry. In 2022, I spent two weeks on board the Modoc, a former U.S. Navy boat that the nonprofit Earthrace Conservation uses as a patrol vessel, visiting Chinese squid ships off the coast of South America. As we were sailing back to a Galápagos port, an Ecuadorian Navy ship approached us, and an officer said that our permit to reënter Ecuadorian waters had been revoked. “If you do not turn around now, we will board and arrest you,” he said. He told us to sail to another country. We didn’t have enough food and water for the journey. After two days of negotiations, we were briefly allowed into the port, where armed Ecuadorian officers boarded; they claimed that the ship’s permits had been filed improperly and that our ship had deviated slightly in its approved course while exiting national waters. Such violations typically result in nothing more than a written citation. But, according to Ambassador Fitzpatrick, the explanation was a bit more complicated. He said that the Chinese government had contacted several Ecuadorian lawmakers to raise concerns about the presence of what they depicted as a quasi-military vessel engaging in covert operations. When I spoke with Juan Carlos Holguín, the Ecuadorian Foreign Minister at the time, he denied that China was involved. But Fitzpatrick told me that Quito treads carefully when it comes to China, in part because Ecuador is deeply in debt to the country. “China did not like the Modoc,” he said. “But mostly it did not want more media coverage on its squid fleet.” The day of Aritonang’s death, Reyes filed a report with the Uruguayan Coast Guard, and showed officers her photographs. “They seemed pretty uninterested,” she said. The following day, a local coroner conducted an autopsy. “A situation of physical abuse emerged,” the report reads. I sent it to Weedn, the forensic pathologist, who told me that the body showed signs of violence and that untreated beriberi seems to have been the cause of death. Nicolas Potrie, who runs the Indonesian consulate in Montevideo, remembered getting a call from Mirta Morales, the prosecutor who investigated Aritonang’s case. “We need to continue trying to figure out what happened. These marks—everybody saw them,” Potrie recalled her saying. (A representative for Rongcheng Wangdao said that the company had found no evidence of misconduct on the ship: “There was nothing regarding your alleged appalling incidents about abuse, violation, insults to one’s character, physical violence or withheld salaries.” The company said that it had handed the matter over to the China Overseas Fisheries Association. Questions submitted to the association went unanswered.) Potrie pressed for further inquiry, but none seemed forthcoming. Morales declined to share any information about the case with me. In March of 2022, I visited Aldo Braida, the president of the Chamber of Foreign Fishing Agents, which represents companies working with foreign vessels in Uruguay, at his office in Montevideo. He dismissed the accounts of mistreatment on Chinese ships that dock in the port as “fake news,” claiming, “There are a lot of lies around this.” He told me that, if crew members whose bodies were disembarked in Montevideo had suffered physical abuse, Uruguayan authorities would discover it, and that, when you put men in close quarters, fights were likely to break out. “We live in a violent society,” he said. Uruguay has little incentive to scrutinize China further, because the country brings lucrative business to the region. In 2018, for example, a Chinese company that had bought a nearly seventy-acre plot of land west of Montevideo presented a plan to build a more than two-hundred-million-dollar “megaport.” Local media reported that the port would be a free-trade zone and include half-mile-long docks, a shipyard, a fuelling station, and seafood storage and processing facilities. The Uruguayan government had been pursuing such Chinese investment for years. The President at the time, Tabaré Vázquez, attempted to sidestep the constitution, which requires a two-thirds vote by both chambers of the General Assembly, and authorize construction of the port by executive order. “There’s so much money on the table that politicians start bending the law to grab at it,” Milko Schvartzman, a marine researcher based in Argentina, told me. But, following resistance from the public and from opposition parties, the plan was called off. The seafood industry is difficult to police. A large portion of fish consumed in the U.S. is caught or processed by Chinese companies. Several laws exist to prevent the U.S. from importing products tainted by forced labor, including that which is involved in the production of conflict diamonds and sweatshop goods. But China is not forthcoming with details about its ships and processing plants. At one point, on a Chinese ship, a deckhand showed me stacks of frozen catch in white bags. He explained that they leave the ship names off the bags so that they can be easily transferred between vessels. This practice allows seafood companies to hide their ties to ships with criminal histories. On the bridge of another ship, a Chinese captain opened his logbook, which is supposed to document his catch. The first two pages had notations; the rest were blank. “No one keeps those,” he said. Company officials could reverse engineer the information later. Kenneth Kennedy, a former manager of the anti-forced-labor program at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that the U.S. government should block seafood imports from China until American companies can demonstrate that their supply chains are free of abuse. “The U.S. is awash with criminally tainted seafood,” he said. These companies included retail chains such as Costco, Kroger, H Mart, and Safeway.
 They also included food-service distributors like Sysco and Performance Food Group, each servicing hundreds of thousands of restaurants and cafeterias at colleges, hotels, hospitals, and government buildings. (These companies did not respond to requests for comment.)
 It’s likely that some of the squid Aritonang died catching ended up on an American plate.
 To document the gaps in the system, we followed the supply chain to show where squid tainted by worker abuse might end up.
 First, we tracked the Zhen Fa 7 by satellite, from 2018 to 2022.
 During that time, it transferred its catch to seven refrigerated reefers.
 We then tracked the journey of one reefer, the Lu Rong Yuan Yu Yun 177, to China’s Shidao port.
 It is especially difficult to document where the catch goes once it gets to port. Arduous in-person tracking is sometimes the only way to follow its movements.
 We hired private investigators in China to track a shipment of squid from the Lu Rong Yuan Yu Yun 177. They hid in their car at the port, filming at a distance as workers unloaded the squid and then packed it into trucks.
 They followed the trucks out of the port.
 The trucks eventually arrived at a seafood facility owned by a company called Rongcheng Xinhui Aquatic Products.
 We also reviewed the ownership details of the other reefers that transshipped with the Zhen Fa 7 and found that its squid likely ended up at five additional processing plants in China.
 Two of these plants, owned by Chishan Group, have employed at least a hundred and seventy workers transferred from Xinjiang, according to local news reports and corporate newsletters on the company’s Web site. (A representative from Rongcheng Haibo, one of the plants, said that the company “has never employed any Xinjiang workers.” A representative from Shandong Haidu, the other plant, said, “There is no use of illegal workers from Xinjiang or other countries, and we recently passed human-rights audits.” Chishan Group did not respond to requests for comment.)
 The plants connected to the Zhen Fa 7 then sent large quantities of their seafood to at least sixty-two American importers.
 On April 22nd, Aritonang’s body was flown from Montevideo to Jakarta, then driven, in a wooden casket with a Jesus figurine on top, to his family home in Batu Lungun. Villagers lined the road to pay their respects; Aritonang’s mother wailed and fainted upon seeing the casket.
 A funeral was soon held, and Aritonang was buried a few feet from his father, in a cemetery plot not far from his church. His grave marker consisted of two slats of wood joined to make a cross. That night, an official from Aritonang’s manning agency visited the family at their home to discuss what locals call a “peace agreement.” Anhar said that the family ended up accepting a settlement of some two hundred million rupiah, or roughly thirteen thousand dollars. Family members were reluctant to talk about the events on the ship. Aritonang’s brother Beben said that he didn’t want his family to get in trouble and that talking about the case might cause problems for his mother. “We, Daniel’s family, have made peace with the ship people and have let him go,” he said. Last year, thirteen months after Aritonang’s death, I spoke again to his family by video chat. His mother, Regina Sihombing, sat on a leopard-print rug in her living room with her son Leonardo. The room had no furniture and no place to sit other than the floor. The house had undergone repairs with money from the settlement, according to the village chief; in the end, it seems, Aritonang had managed to fix up his parents’ home after all. When the conversation turned to him, his mother began to weep. “You can see how I am now,” she said. Leonardo told her, “Don’t be sad. It was his time.” ♦ This piece was produced with contributions from Joe Galvin, Maya Martin, Susan Ryan, Austin Brush, and Daniel Murphy.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,"10 killer whales caught this year by trawl vessels off Alaska, according to federal fisheries agency"," Obituaries• Games• ADN Store• e-Edition• Sponsored Content• Promotions Obituaries• Games• ADN Store• e-Edition• Sponsored Content• Promotions• Get our free newsletters Killer whales in Resurrection Bay. (iStock / Getty Images)  A federal fishery agency reported last week that 10 killer whales were caught in the gear of trawl net vessels fishing this year in the Bering Sea and North Pacific waters off the Aleutian Islands. Only one was released alive, according to a brief Alaska NOAA Fisheries statement posted online. A team is analyzing data collected about the other nine whales to determine the cause of injury or death, and also to determine which stocks these whales belonged to through reviewing genetic information. Killer whales, also known as orcas, have been entangled in trawl gear off Alaska in years past, but the numbers reported in 2023 are higher. . “The agency is working quickly to evaluate these incidents and will share findings as soon as possible, after all required analyses are completed,” the statement said. The agency reported that another killer whale was entangled with longline gear set out by a vessel that a private vessel contracted to conduct a federal fishery survey in the Central Bering Sea. On June 7, a dead whale was observed caught up in gear, the statement said. NOAA Fisheries scientists were on board the survey vessel, which was designed to provide an assessment of black cod — also known as sablefish — populations, and that incident is also under review. Bering Sea killer whales fall under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which includes requirements for vessel owners or operators to report injuries or deaths. All of the trawl vessels involved in the whale deaths this year were required to carry two federally contracted observers that collect information about the catch. Their observations about the killer whale have been submitted to the NOAA Fisheries team reviewing the incidents. The whale encounters with trawl gear have been discussed on social media. Alaska NOAA Fisheries posted a statement Thursday headlined “Response to Recent Reports of Killer Whale Incidental Catches in Alaska.” The statement did not provide additional details about the incidents, including what types of trawlers encountered the whales, and an agency spokesperson didn’t respond to requests Friday afternoon for more information. In a written statement, the Groundfish Forum, a Seattle-based trawl fishery group, confirmed that member vessels were involved in at least some of the whale deaths as well as the one released alive. Groundfish Forum members operate 19 vessels that net and process yellowfin sole, Pacific Ocean perch and other bottom-dwelling species. “Our fleet is committed to finding solutions to this unprecedented challenge. We have invested in research activities to better understand the change in killer whale behavior and how to avoid them,” the statement said. “Vessels are experimenting with gear modifications that may prevent whales from entering the net.” For decades, killer whales have been drawn to fishing boats off Alaska. Longliners, which drop lines of baited hooks, have generated many of these encounter reports. The whales eat black cod, stripping them off hooks, as they’re brought to the surface. Sablefish longliners have tried many tactics to fend them off, including blasting heavy metal music from the decks. Some have switched to fishing with baited pots to keep them away. Trawlers also have had encounters with killer whales, including two — a male and female that died in 2020 died after being caught in Bering Sea flatfish trawl gear, according to a NOAA Fisheries document. From 2014 to 2020, seven killer whales died or suffered serious injury due to encounters with all types of fishing gear, according to a federal study cited by the Groundfish Forum in the statement. In recent years, Groundfish Forum trawler crews have encountered killer whales more frequently, and those contacts appear to have intensified this year. “In 2023, our captains have reported an increase in the number of killer whales present near our vessels, where they appear to be feeding in front of the nets while fishing,” said the statement from the Groundfish Forum, which called this “new behavior.” Megan Williams, a fishery scientist with the Ocean Conservancy, said killer whales are incredibly intelligent animals, and that “conflicts arising with trawl fisheries need to be addressed,” along with larger concerns about how to manage the Bering Sea more holistically. “This may represent a conservation concern for killer whales,” said Williams, who studied killer whale interactions with Bering Sea fisheries for years and noted that there are three broad ecotypes — fish-eaters, those that focus on marine mammal prey and a third group of which less is known. In the North Pacific, adult killer whales are long-lived and reproduce slowly. The males can reach an age of at least 50 years and the females as old as 80, according to an Alaska Department of Fish and Game species profile posted online. The fish-eaters feed on a wide variety of species, and large groups are often involved in hunting their prey. Typical dives last three to five minutes, but a lot is unknown about their diving behavior, according to the Department of Fish and Game document. The NOAA and Groundfish Forum statements do not offer information on how the whales got caught in the nets. So, it is unclear whether they may have been low in the water column, or got entangled as the net was drawn to the surface. Groundfish Forum trawler operators are still trying to understand why they are encountering more killer whales. For the GroundFish Forum fleet, one area of concern has been halibut that they incidentally bring up as bycatch as they target other species. Longline fishermen report that whales have taken halibut from hooks. The trawl-caught halibut appear to be an attractant to the killer whales because they are designated as a prohibited species and must be discarded after they are brought on board. To try to improve halibut survival rates, crews sort some halibut on deck and toss them back to the sea. The Groundfish Forum statement said that is not done when killer whales are present. Instead, they are sorted out below deck, and discarded through chutes. “Killer whales were observed feeding on discarded halibut by Hannah Myers, a University of Alaska Fairbanks marine biology graduate student and researcher with the non-profit North Gulf Oceanic Society, which was contracted by the Alaska Seafood Cooperative to study killer whale behavior. Myers spent a week on a trawler in May to learn more about their interactions with the vessel and its gear. “Basically every halibut I saw go out of the whole fish discharge chute — the whales were on it,” said Myers, who is finishing her doctorate degree and has focused her research on killer whales. Myers said that she was far less concerned about the risk to the whales from feeding near boats than other behavior. During her week aboard the vessel, Myers was able to track some 30 tows with a hydrophone that acts like an underwater recording microphone and was attached to a headrope of a net. Those recordings indicated that the whales were deep underwater as the net was being towed, and making clicking sounds associated with foraging. She said one possibility was that the whales were pursuing fish in front of the net, or possibly eating fish from the outer mesh or even chasing fish into the net. “This is something that would be high-risk behavior for them,” Myers said. [Killer conversations: UAF grad student keeps track of orca whale communications with underwater microphones] Whales also were spotted around the nets as they came to the surface and brought to the boat, according to Myers, who said that activity also posed risks. Since 2020, Myers said, killer whale deaths from the trawl fleet have been on the rise, though lower than in 2023. This year, she said, the majority of the dead whales were found inside the nets. It is unclear why some killer whales have been focusing on the trawl nets. Myers said it could be due to a loss of other sources of prey that prompted a shift to more reliance on foraging around the trawlers. During her week at sea, Myers estimated about two dozen whales were around the boat. They showed up when the boat started fishing and never left. “Certain pods were targeting the vessel, and I think it’s very lucrative behavior for them because they are staying with the vessel 24/7.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,A ship carrying 800 tonnes of Li-Ion batteries caught fire. What could possibly go wrong?,,2024-01-02
Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,'Take the boat and jail them:' Outrage over video showing boaters dumping trash off Florida coast," Louis Aguirre, Anchor/Reporter/Environmental Advocate Published: April 30, 2024, 12:16 PM Louis Aguirre, Anchor/Reporter/Environmental Advocate BOCA RATON, Fla. – State law enforcement officials are investigating after a group of young boaters were caught on camera dumping trash right into the ocean in the waters off South Florida over the weekend — and then celebrating what they did. It’s sparking outrage over social media, according to News 6 partner WPLG. The video, taken by social media content creator Wavy Boats, shows the group dumping two garbage cans full of trash into the ocean about a mile and a half offshore the Boca Raton Inlet Sunday afternoon. Wavy Boats took the video as the vessel was leaving the annual Boca Bash on Lake Boca, speeding east on the inlet despite huge swells, then stopping to dump the trash — cans, bottles, plastic cups — right into the sea. The video shows some of it floating on the surface as the boaters sped back into the inlet to rejoin the party. The video went viral and was reposted on several accounts with tens of thousands of people commenting and expressing anger. “The boat should be confiscated and sold at auction,” one comment read. Another reads, “Take their boat and jail them!” A spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said the agency is investigating. The agency confirmed to Local 10 that agents know who the boat belongs to and are working to identify everyone on board. Organizers of Boca Bash released a statement that reads in part: “It is irresponsible boat owners like this that give the event a bad reputation. The Boca Bash regularly asks attendees to keep our waterways clean all the way up to the event date. We do not condone drinking and operating a vessel by any means and cannot stress enough how imperative it is to keep our local waters clean.” Some of the boaters appear to be minors. There’s no word on any arrests or if their parents will be held accountable. Violations of Florida’s litter law can result in civil penalties, fines, and possible prison sentences.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,Fish and Overfishing," How are fish stocks changing across the world? How much is overfished? By: Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser This article was first published in October 2021 and last updated in March 2024. Many thanks to Ray Hilborn, Michael Melnychuk, Max Mossler, and Daniel Hively from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database for providing data and feedback for this project. See all interactive charts on fish and overfishing ↓ Other research and writing on fish and overfishing on Our World in Data: The world produces around 200 million tonnes of fish and seafood every year. This comes from a combination of wild fish catch and fish farming. In fact, the rapid growth of aquaculture over the last few decades means we now produce more seafood from fish farms than we do from fisheries. Which countries produce the most seafood? We can break this down by wild catch and fish farming. But let’s first look at total production from the sum of these two methods. This is shown in the map here. China is the world’s largest seafood producer. The chart here shows the distribution of wild fish catch by country. This is total seafood production minus aquaculture (fish farming). By clicking on any country, you can see how its production has changed over time. The two charts here show the distribution of fish farming (also known as ‘aquaculture’) by country. First is the global distribution, as shown on the map. Second, as in the regional breakdown, you can also add and compare countries using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Most of the world’s growth in aquaculture production has come from East Asia and the Pacific. For example, China produces more food from aquaculture than any other country. This growth in aquaculture has played an important role in increasing global seafood production without sacrificing fish stocks. Production has continued to grow while the output of wild fisheries has slowed or even plateaued. This allows us to maintain sustainable fishing levels that do not deplete wild fish populations. Most records of global fish catch only date back decades. But, of course, fishing is an industry that dates back much further. We don't have good global records that go so far back in time, but we can draw upon data from some rich countries that have statistical records dating back centuries. This gives us insights into how modern-day fishing compares to the more distant past. In the chart here, we see five centuries of cod catch in Eastern Canada.1 These fishing records date back to the year 1500. We see that fish catch started to increase from around 1700 through to the mid-20th century. It peaked in 1968 before a collapse in fish stocks led to a dramatic decline. In fact, fisheries were forced to close 24 years later, in the early 1990s. Since then, stocks have not been able to recover due to the reopening of fisheries and their overexploitation afterward. Historical records from the UK give us a further understanding of the long-term trend in fisheries. In their paper, published in Nature, researchers Ruth Thurstan and colleagues reconstruct UK fisheries trends dating back more than a century.2 This measures the catch of bottom-dwelling fish – excluding shellfish. We see a steep rise in fish catch over the first half of the 20th century. The development of steam trawlers in the 1880s allowed vessels to fish further offshore, for longer periods of time, and with gear that could reach deeper into the ocean. This increase in fish catch was interrupted by the two World Wars: we see the dramatic declines in catch shown on the chart. This inter-war decline was due to a couple of factors: fishing became much more dangerous, and vessels were redirected from fishing towards military and other uses.3 Even after the World Wars, the fish catch began to dramatically decline over the second half of the 20th century. We might hypothesize that this decline was the result of reduced fishing efforts. But, this is not reflected in the data on fishing activity. When we look at the amount of fish caught per unit of fishing power (the number of fishing vessels multiplied by the fishing effort per vessel) we also see a dramatic decline. This shows the reduction in catch has been driven by a decline in the availability of bottom-living fish rather than changes in fishing efforts. Say the word ‘fishing’, and very different images come to mind. Some of us might picture a lone fisherman with a wooden fishing rod. Others will picture a 100-meter-wide net being dragged along the seafloor by an industrial ship. There are a variety of ways to catch fish. These matters because they depend on what fish we want to catch, how much fish we can catch (and ultimately, the amount of fish we have to eat and the income fishers get), and what the ecological impacts are. Discussions on fisheries can be full of jargon. If you’re not familiar with this research, it can be difficult to understand exactly what each method looks like and what it entails. To make this easier, I have created the following visualization, which presents an overview of the most common fishing methods. This is based on summary visuals from the Marine Stewardship Council. This gear is used across the world, but there are some general patterns where certain methods are more widely used. Pole-and-line, longline, and gillnet methods are more common in lower-income countries where much of the fishing activity is subsistence or small-scale. Purse seine and trawling methods are more common in industrial fishing practices; these tend to catch more fish per unit of effort. However, the downside is that they tend to have larger negative impacts, with more bycatch (catch of fish that are not the target species) and, in some cases, damage to the seabed. Now that we have some understanding of what each of these methods means, let’s look at how common each is. In the charts, we see the breakdown of global wild fish catch by the type of fishing gear used. This data is sourced from the Sea Around Us database, published by Daniel Pauly, Dirk Zeller, and Maria Palomares.4 Globally, bottom trawling is the most common method, accounting for one-quarter of fish catch. Pelagic (midwater) trawling accounts for an additional 10%. This means all types of trawling account for just over one-third of global fish catch. Purse seine fishing is the second most common method, accounting for just over 20% of the catch. Gillnets and longlines account for much less of global fish catch. This is partly a result of the fact that they achieve less catch per landing than methods such as trawling or purse seine. It’s interesting to see how common methods are across different countries. You can explore this data for any country using the + ‘Edit countries and regions’ on the interactive charts. For example, we see that bottom trawling is the dominant method used in China. In contrast, bottom trawling is becoming less common across Europe. In many countries – such as the UK, Spain, and Portugal – bottom trawling was intense throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s but has since declined significantly. That has been partly driven by efforts to reduce overfishing and allow fish stocks to rebuild. In addition, the European Commission banned bottom trawling in deep waters – those below 800m in depth – in 2016. In countries where most fishing is subsistent – Bangladesh is one example – it’s small-scale fishing practices that dominate. Large-scale practices are almost non-existent. Finally, we see that larger-scale practices are growing in some countries as they transition from small, subsistence fishing to larger industrial practices. In Ghana, for example, purse seine is one of the most common forms of fishing. Fish and seafood is an important source of nutrition for many people across the world. Not only does it provide an important source of protein, but fish also contains other nutrients and vitamins that are important for overall health, such as vitamin A, calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.5 How much fish do people across the world eat, and how much of our nutrition does it provide? Some countries in the world eat close to 100 kilograms of seafood per person each year. Others average only a few kilograms. In the charts here, we see the average per capita consumption of fish and seafood across the world.6 The highest seafood consumers are countries including Iceland, the Maldives, and Hong Kong. Contrast that with those at the bottom of the table: landlocked countries such as Mongolia, Afghanistan, and Niger understandably eat relatively little fish. There is a strong relationship between income and overall meat consumption: as we get richer, we tend to eat more meat. This relationship is not as strong for seafood. Many lower-income countries rely on subsistence fishing as a key food source. How much of our total protein, from plant and animal sources, comes from seafood? In the chart here, we see the per capita protein intake from different sources across the world. Globally, less than 10% of total protein intake comes from seafood.7 In some countries, it accounts for a much larger share: around one-third in the Maldives and one-fifth in Japan, Iceland, and Cambodia. It’s possible to get all of the protein we need from plant sources. However, to get all of the amino acids (the building blocks of protein) from a plant-based diet, one needs to have the right variety of foods. It requires a balance of staples such as cereals and more complete proteins such as legumes (peas and beans). Unfortunately, many in poorer countries are heavily reliant on cereals and lack this dietary diversity. In this case, animal protein sources can be vitally important for human health. So, how much of our animal protein comes from seafood? Globally, around one-sixth of our animal protein comes from seafood.7 In the charts here, we see the breakdown of animal protein consumption by country. In some countries, seafood dominates. It accounts for the majority of animal protein in Cambodia, Bangladesh, and the Maldives. For billions of people across the world, fish is an important source of nutrition. Fish plays an important role in nutrition for communities across the world. For many, it is a key source of high-quality protein and provides other vital micronutrients for health. However, people also rely on fishing and fish farming as primary sources of income. How many people are employed in these industries? The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates around 60 million people globally are employed as fishers (catching wild fish) or fish farming (aquaculture). The breakdown of employment by region and the split between fisheries and fish farming is shown in the chart. More people are employed in wild catch than fish farming: a difference of 39 million to 21 million. Unsurprisingly, Asia is home to most of the world’s fishers and fish farmers. The following chart shows us how employment has changed over recent decades. Globally, employment in the industry has increased, but with much faster growth in aquaculture. In 1995, fish farming was a relatively small industry, but it has grown rapidly in the last few decades. More of our seafood now comes from aquaculture than from wild catch. Employment in fishing has increased in every region except Europe. The number of fishers across Europe peaked around the year 2000 and has markedly declined since then [you can view these trends by region using the blue “Change region” button]. The seafood industry is not only an important source of nutrition for many; it is also a key source of income for millions of people. Both those employed directly as fishers or fish farmers and those employed through indirect jobs such as food processing, sourcing, and the management of fisheries. Is the global fishing industry sustainable? Which types of fish are we harvesting sustainably, and where are we overfishing? These are critical questions, but to answer them, we need to first agree on what ‘sustainability’ actually means when it comes to fishing. One of the biggest conflicts I see is not actually about technical discussions of how much fish we catch or whether populations are increasing or decreasing, but a larger ethical conflict in how we view fish. When we view fish through different lenses, these debates don’t get very far. One school of thought views fish as animals with their own inherent value. In this realm, our end goal is often to restore wild animal populations to as close to their pre-human levels as possible. Ultimately, this means we should be catching very little (if any at all). The other school of thought views fish as a resource. Most of us eat fish; hundreds of millions rely on it for nutrition and income across the world. This is incompatible with restoring populations to their historical levels because we can’t do that and catch lots of fish at the same time. Sustainability, in this view, means catching as many fish as possible without depleting fish populations any further. This ties in with the classic Brundtland definition of sustainability: “meeting the needs of the current generation, without sacrificing the needs of future generations”. We catch as many fish as possible to meet the needs of people alive today but don’t take too much such that populations decline, and this sacrifices catch for future generations. We can see these two schools of thought emerge in the typical diagram of sustainable fishing. On the x-axis, we have fishing pressure; as we move towards the right, we catch a larger proportion of the fish stock each year. Fishing pressure tells us about the fraction of the fish population that is caught in a given year. Note that this measure is a flow – it is an input variable that changes over time. On the y-axis, we have fish biomass, which is given as two variables. First, we have the fish catch – shown as the red line. This, again, is a flow variable. Second, we have fish stocks. The fish stock is the total amount of fish left in the population. It, as we'd expect, is a stock variable. Let’s first look at the ‘stock’ line. This is the amount of fish we have in the oceans. It slopes downwards towards the right: if we fish very little, then lots of fish are left in the ocean, and as we increase fishing pressure, we deplete the amount of fish in our oceans. This makes sense. Our first school of thought – that fish are not a resource but a wild animal population in their own right – suggests we should be aiming for the top-left corner. Fish populations are as close to pre-human levels as possible. To do this, we need to catch very little (if any) fish. Our second school of thought – that fish are a resource – would consider the optimal level to be the red dot. This is what is called the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. This is a key concept in fishery research and industry. It’s the largest long-term average catch that can be taken from a fish stock under prevailing environmental and fishery conditions. If you get greedy and catch more than this, then you deplete populations for future generations. If you catch too little, then you’re sacrificing food and income for the current generation. Most fisheries are aiming for this sweet spot: catching not too much, not too little, just right. The tension between these two schools becomes obvious. The optimal outcome is completely different. When the biomass of a fish stock is at the point where the ‘maximum sustainable yield’ can be achieved, it’s around half of its original virgin biomass.8 This level can vary between fish populations but is typically in the range of 37% to 50% of its pre-fishing levels. This may seem counterintuitive, but wild animal population growth rates are often greatest when the population size is moderate and before the population starts to reach its natural limit, or carrying capacity. In other words, if you view fish as a resource, you probably want fish populations to be less than half the size of pre-fishing size in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield. Most of the research, industry, and policymaking is geared towards the second school: viewing fish as a resource. Therefore, much of our work on fish on Our World in Data will explore these concepts and explain what the research and data tell us about fish stocks, catch, and the sustainability of fishing across the world. However, we will also offer the perspective of the first school by looking at how fish populations have changed from their pre-human levels. Sustainable fishing, by its fisheries definition, is catching just the right amount. If you harvest too much, then fish stocks decline. If you catch too little, then you’re giving up valuable food resources and income. In the previous section, we take a closer look at different concepts of sustainable fishing and how this ‘sweet spot’ – the maximum sustainable yield – is defined. How much of the world’s fish is caught sustainably? This is often measured in terms of fish stocks. A fish stock is a subpopulation of a particular species of fish with common parameters such as location, growth, and mortality. Often, it’s a species of fish in a given location. Indian Ocean tuna, for example. Importantly, this metric treats each fish stock as being equal, regardless of how big each stock is. A stock where we catch 1000 tonnes is counted the same as a stock where we catch 10 tonnes. When defining the sustainability of fisheries, we need to know three terms: Overfished: this is sometimes termed ‘overexploited’. A fish stock with abundance below the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is potentially considered ""overfished"". Fish stocks become overexploited when fish are caught at a rate higher than the fish population can support. Maximally sustainably fished: this has sometimes been termed ‘fully fished’ or ‘fully exploited’ in the past. Some might interpret these terms negatively, but this is actually the ‘sweet spot’ that fisheries are aiming for. This is the maximum sustainable yield, where we’re catching as much fish as possible without reducing fish populations below the most productive level. Underfished: this is when the fish stock is greater than the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield. We could catch more fish without the decline of fish populations. From a resource point of view, this is suboptimal because we’re missing out on a key food source and income source from fishing communities. The breakdown of these three categories is shown in the chart. Combined, underfished and maximally fished would be considered to be sustainable because fish stocks are not declining. One-third (34%) of assessed global fish stocks were overfished in 2017. However, 60% were maximally fished, and 6% were underfished. But this does not tell us how much fish was sourced sustainably. This is because fish stocks can be very different sizes. Let’s say we have two fish stocks. Stock A is sustainable, and we’re catching 80 tonnes of fish per year. Stock B is unsustainable, and we’re catching 20 tonnes from it. If we aggregate them, we’d conclude that only half of our fish stocks are sustainable, but 80% of our catch is. When we adjust for the different amounts of catch from each stock, we find that almost four-fifths (79%) of fish catch is sourced sustainably. 21% of the catch comes from overfished populations. Overall, two-thirds of assessed fisheries are sustainable, providing four-fifths of our seafood. This gives us a static view of global fisheries, but how has this been changing over time? Are things getting worse? The chart here shows the status of the world’s fish stocks from the 1970s. The share of overfished stocks has increased over the last half-century. In the 1970s, around 10% were overexploited. Although exploitation rates varied year-to-year, this generally increased through the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Over recent decades, there has been some variability, but overfishing has hovered around one-third globally. Some regions are fishing much more sustainably than others. In the following section, we look at which are managing well and which are doing poorly. Sometimes, there are claims that seem so far-fetched that it’s hard to imagine they need to be addressed. But this is one that simply won’t die – it has been repeated so many times that many believe it to be true. It hit the headlines again after being featured in the popular Netflix documentary Seaspiracy earlier this year. It made the claim that: ""If current fishing trends continue, we will see virtually empty oceans by the year 2048"". Seaspiracy is far from the first source to repeat this claim: Google “empty oceans by 2048,” and you will find hundreds of thousands of results. What’s the story here? Where did this claim come from, and is it true? In 2006, the fisheries researcher Boris Worm and his colleagues published a paper in Science on the trends in biodiversity loss in the world’s oceans.9 The year 2048 and prospects for ‘global collapse’, were only mentioned once and featured in the conclusion of the article: Our data highlight the societal consequences of an ongoing erosion of diversity that appears to be accelerating on a global scale. This trend is of serious concern because it projects the global collapse of all taxa currently fished by the mid–21st century (based on the extrapolation of regression to 100% in the year 2048). How did they reach this conclusion? Well, they plotted the historical decline in ‘collapsed taxa’, as shown in the chart. If we take this black trend line and continue extrapolating it into the future, it will cross 100% in 2048. In other words, if we assume taxa continued to collapse at a constant rate, it would reach zero by mid-century. This raises the important question of what the authors meant by the term ‘collapse’ and how it was calculated. They defined a ‘collapse’ as the case where fish catch was below 10% of their historical recorded maximum. Their data came from the UN FAO database on fisheries ‘landings’ (the amount of fish brought back to land). At the time, there was a lack of high-quality data on fish abundance, so there was only catch data to go on. Unfortunately, this somewhat broad-brush projection was the highlight picked up by the media. The New York Times ran the headline “Study Sees 'Global Collapse' of Fish Species"", and coverage snowballed from there. Even if the authors’ projection did come true, and fisheries did collapse by 2048, the leap to “the oceans will be empty in 2048” is scientifically implausible. The definition of a fisheries collapse is not an ocean of no fish. Catch may be low because populations have been depleted. But there are clearly still fish: we're still catching them. Obviously, this is not an optimal place to be, whether you care about the fish or the fishers. But it does not mean an empty ocean. As we will see later, this prediction has not played out in reality. The aftermath of their paper in 2006 created a lot of uproar in the fishery research community. There were many rebuttal papers challenging this position. The research community had previously been divided: one camp had a more optimistic take on the status of the world’s fisheries and prospects for the future; one had a more pessimistic take. Boris Worm fell into the latter. To their credit, these two sides soon joined forces, working collaboratively to get a much larger and more rigorous overview of the status of the world’s fish populations. The figureheads on both sides of the debate – Ray Hilborn and Boris Worm – both featured in a debate on National Public Radio. In the aftermath, they formed a collaborative project facilitated by the National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis (NCEAS) to get to the bottom of it. Rather than relying on reported data on fish catch, the scientists set out to build a database on global fish stocks. This does not focus on the amount of fish being caught but the abundance of fish in each population. Scientists can do this through a combination of sonar acoustic methods (which lets them build a picture of the number and density of fish) and fishing (which lets them identify specific species in the ecosystem). They published their results in 2009 in the journal Science.10 They concluded that although around two-thirds of assessed fisheries are below the biomass that would give us the maximum sustainable yield, catch is now within or even below sustainable levels in 7 of the 10 studied ecosystems. In other words, while many stocks are still in a poor state, things are improving across many ecosystems. The decline that Worm et al. projected in their earlier paper has not come true. Many fisheries are in a stable position and do not follow the projected curve of collapse. The divergence of these two trends is shown in the chart. First, in red, we see the observations in the Worm et al. (2006) paper from UN FAO catch data. We see that by extrapolating the trend line, it will reach 100% in 2048. In blue, we see the more recent data from Worm and Hilborn’s collaboration on fish stock (abundance) data. It shows a more stable trend in collapse stocks over the last few decades. This mirrors the UN FAO's assessment of fisheries. It estimates that around one-third of the world’s fish stocks are overexploited: these populations are declining because we’re catching more fish than can reproduce. The other two-thirds, though, are sustainable and not in decline. The share that is overexploited has been relatively stable in recent decades. It has not continued at the rates predicted. The most recent analysis of global fish stocks – published by the same group in 2020 – reaffirms this result.11 There are certainly fish stocks that are of major concern. But overall, the majority of regions where we have high-quality data are at least stable.12 To be clear, this does not undermine the fact that some of the world’s fish populations are struggling. Many are in trouble and are at risk of collapse if we do not take action. But the notion that the world’s fisheries will collapse within decades is wrong. Even the original authors do not stand by this statement.13 The extrapolation of this original claim to the “oceans will be empty by 2048” is nonsense that does not reflect the science that underpins it. The health of the world’s fish populations is one of our biggest concerns when it comes to the sustainability of fishing. Compared to other meats, seafood has a low environmental footprint when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and nutrient pollution – we looked at this later on. But with wild fish populations, we have another dimension to consider: what’s happening to their population numbers. When we catch fish faster than they can reproduce, these numbers decline. Earlier on, we looked at assessments of overfishing, and we found that around one-third of global fish stocks are overfished. [A ‘fish stock’ is a fish population in a given location – Bluefin Tuna in the Pacific Ocean, for example]. This is useful but doesn’t really tell us how fish stocks around the world are doing. As consumers, we want to know what types of fish to buy or where to source them. At the industry, national, or global level, we want to know this so we can take action on the stocks that are not doing well. What do we know about the health of fish stocks across the world? There are several methods we use to better understand the health of fish stocks. One method is small-scale scientific surveys in specific regions. This certainly gives us some indication of fish populations, but they are often localized and don’t give us a complete health profile. The second is to do large-scale stock assessments. These assessments have become the bedrock of fisheries management. The RAM Legacy database – first launched in 2009 – is led by a team at the University of Washington – and is the most widely used in research and is adopted by the UN Fisheries Division. Back in 2009, it covered 166 of the world’s fish stocks, which accounted for around 20% of global fish catch.10 Today, it covers over 1,200 fish stocks, which is more than 50% of the global catch. It covers many of the world’s key fishing regions: the United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Europe, Peru, Chile, Argentina, high-seas tuna fisheries, New Zealand, and Japan, plus most of the major fisheries of South Africa and Australia. Unfortunately, there are key regions where we have very little data. The database is missing data from most Asian, African, and Latin American fisheries. We see this in the map, which details the coverage of fish stocks in the RAM database. Most fisheries across Europe and the Americas have good coverage. Most fisheries across Asia do not. We will soon look at what’s happening to fish stocks in the regions for which we have good data. But first we should see what we know (if anything) about the stocks that are missing. Stock assessments are used by fisheries across the world to understand the health of fish populations and implement strategies to manage their fisheries. For example, they might be used to set catch limits at levels that are sustainable, given the dynamics and health of the fish population. They are carried out using the ‘ABC’ method. This is the collection of three key metrics: A = Abundance. Scientists use acoustics and other methods to monitor and estimate the abundance of fish at any given time. B = Biological factors. Sampled fish are taken to assess the age and population growth rate of the population. For example, we might need to know the ratio of adult versus juvenile fish to estimate the reproduction rate of the population. C = Catch. Data is collected on how many fish are being caught. Scientists then used these three inputs – abundance, biology, and catch – to model the population dynamics of the fish stock. Abundance and biology tell us how many fish we would otherwise expect to be there before we remove any. Catch tells us how many we’re taking out. The balance of these two gives us an estimate of how many there really are. We don't have good stock assessments across Asia, Africa (except South Africa), and much of Latin America. But can we say anything about how they might be doing? Well, first, the very fact that we don’t have good data is itself bad news. Managing the sustainability of fisheries is a delicate process – to do it well we need continual monitoring of the fish populations, their reproduction rate, and how much fish we’re catching. This balance can change from season to season or even month to month as environmental factors change and affect the dynamics of the ecosystem. Regions that manage fisheries well are constantly monitoring and changing catch limits when necessary. Fisheries that are not carrying out these assessments will struggle to maintain this balance. That’s most of the fisheries across Asia, Africa, and South America. Fishing pressure in many of these regions is intense. Bottom-trawling – where large fishing nets are dragged along the seabed – is very high in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia. Maintaining such high rates of fishing without monitoring them closely makes it unlikely that fish stocks are in a healthy state. One of the ways that we can assess the pressure from trawling is to look at how many times a given area of the seabed is trawled. Some areas are only trawled once every few years. Others are trawled over and over. Research suggests that where stocks are healthy, a net only passes over the same spot once in a period of 3 to 10 years. Across Asia, it’s common for the same area to be trawled 3 to 10 times per year. This has been confirmed by some smaller scientific surveys in the region. Scientific surveys have periodically monitored stocks in the Gulf of Thailand for decades. They show a large reduction in fish stocks over time. Other surveys of trawling efforts across the region show similar declines. Ask local experts about the state of fish stocks, and most have a similar take: they are in poor condition.14 Of course, it won’t apply to all fisheries across these regions. Some will be well-managed and healthy. But, based on what we know (and especially the fact that we don’t know a lot), the consensus is that many of these fish stocks are not in a healthy place. Let’s then turn to the health of fish across the regions for which we do have good assessments. It so happens that these tend to be richer countries: those across Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan. This database covers over 1,200 of these fish stocks, over half of the world’s fish catch. In the chart, we see how these stocks are doing. It shows the biomass of fish populations. That is, essentially, the amount of wild fish there. It’s the number of fish multiplied by their mass. Here, we’re measuring these stocks relative to the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. The maximum sustainable yield is the sweet spot where we can catch as many fish as possible without reducing the fish population below the most productive level. A value of one is the ‘optimal’. We’re maximizing fish catch while keeping populations stable. A value greater than one is good for fish populations (there are more fish) but not good for humans since we’re missing out on fish catch. A value below one is not good: fish stocks are lower than we’d like, and while we might catch more fish in the short term, we will miss out in the longer term. You can add more regions using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Fish stocks are healthy across most of these regions. Australia, Alaska, the US Northeast and Southeast Coasts, Japan, and Europe Atlantic are all above one another, hovering around this optimal value. However, there are a few regions that are not doing so well. The Canadian East Coast has seen a large decline in recent years. Assessed stocks in South America and Africa are struggling. The European Mediterranean is not doing well. This is reflected in the fact that the Black Sea is very overfished. Whether a fish stock is doing well or not is mainly determined by its fishing intensity: what fraction of the population is being caught each year. Fish too much, and the population can’t be maintained. In this chart, we see levels of fishing intensity across the same regions. Again, this is measured relative to the intensity at the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. An optimal value is one. If the intensity is greater than one, then we’re overfishing. Fish stocks tend to be a lagging indicator of fishing intensity. So, if we hold fishing intensity too high (above one) – even if only slightly – then stocks will inevitably fall below one until fishing pressures are reduced. The status of stocks across different regions might tell us where we might find healthy stocks – and, as a result, where we might want to source our fish from – but they’re averaged across many types of fish. It doesn’t tell us about what fish we might want to buy or avoid. How are stocks of tuna, cod, mackerel, or sharks holding up? In the chart, we see the same metric as before – fish stocks measured by biomass – across different types. Across most of the main fish groups – tunas, shrimp, cod, and perch – stocks are at or above ‘one’ – the sweet spot where we catch as many fish as possible while keeping populations stable. That’s good news. Many of our most popular stocks are well-managed and have healthy populations. A few groups are not faring so well. In recent years, mackerel have dropped below the optimal level due to increased fishing intensity. And sharks are declining rapidly – a worrying trend. Let’s look at a few of these species in more detail: tuna, which is doing surprisingly well, and sharks, which are not. The health of tuna populations has been a concern for decades. We often hear that tuna are being overfished to extinction. That we should avoid them if we want to eat sustainably. But many tuna populations are now well-managed. Previously, we looked at the aggregate of tuna stocks; we can zoom in further and look at particular regional stocks. In the chart, we see the health of fish stocks across three oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Tunas in the Atlantic and Pacific are managed close to their ‘maximum sustainable yield’. That’s positive news. The trend looks worse for those in the Indian Ocean. Its stocks have now fallen below one and look to be continuing downwards. Atlantic and Pacific tuna might be a reasonable fish choice. Tuna from the Indian Ocean has less of a guarantee of being from a sustainable source. However, we can go even further and look at specific tuna species, such as bluefin or yellowfin. We see these stocks in the chart. Some tuna stocks have recovered through improved management – especially in the US and European waters. From the chart, we see that many are above one: the maximum sustainable yield. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. Many of the tuna stocks that were the biggest concern have started to turn things around. We see this in this chart, which now shows fish stocks measured as their total mass in tonnes rather than relative to the maximum sustainable yield. Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, we see a massive decline in tuna populations. The Southern bluefin tuna by more than 90% – from over 8.5 million tonnes to less than one million. The Western Pacific yellowfin fell by three-quarters. However, since the millennium, better management of fisheries and reduced overfishing have resulted in many of these stocks showing some signs of recovery. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. While many of the world’s tuna stocks might be starting to recover, shark populations are declining. We previously saw that shark stocks were being overexploited and populations were declining. We see this again in the chart here. What’s even more concerning is that this only tells us about assessed shark populations. Many more stocks have not been assessed – and these are likely to be in regions where monitoring is poor and illegal catch is poorly regulated. There, shark populations might be in even poorer health. In general, sharks and rays tend to grow and reproduce more slowly than other fished species, meaning that it takes longer for individuals who have been caught to be replaced. This contributes to their increased extinction risk, reflected in the IUCN Red List. A third of the world's sharks and rays have been assessed as being threatened with extinction15. However, this slow rate of growth and reproduction is not true of all shark and ray species, and some species can support sustainable fisheries 16. In our Fish Stocks Data Explorer, we present the key metrics for assessed fish stocks from the RAM Legacy Database.17 This provides a high-resolution breakdown of specific fish stocks across the world. For general readers, this might be too detailed. However, it could be useful for those with a background in this area to explore specific fish stocks. One of the best ways to reduce our impact on the environment is by changing what we eat. The research shows us that we can have the biggest impact by eating less meat and dairy. Or substituting lower-impact meats such as chicken and pork for beef and lamb. But I’m often asked the question: “What about fish and seafood? Is that an environmentally-friendly option?”. There are lots of types of seafood: not only different species but also ways of producing them. We can catch them in the wild or grow them in fish farms. But in most comparisons of food products, they’re aggregated into one or two categories, such as “marine fish” or “freshwater fish”. This doesn’t really inform us about what type of fish to eat. Let’s take a closer look at the impacts of specific types of seafood. ‘Environmental impact’ can mean very different things: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use or chemical pollution. It’s useful to look at all of these impacts in case there are large trade-offs between them. In a new study published in Nature, Jessica Gephart and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of the impacts of fish and seafood across multiple environmental metrics.18 To do this, they combined life-cycle analysis data from studies of wild-caught and farmed seafood products. It covered over 1690 fish farms and 1000 records from fisheries. These results look at the impacts on-farm and off-farm, up to the farmgate. That means up to the point that harvested or caught fish are brought back to land. It includes all of the inputs into production, such as fish feed or fuel use in fisheries. It does not include post-farm processes such as transport to retail, packaging, or cooking.19 Here, we’re looking at five key metrics: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, freshwater use, and nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This doesn’t include the sustainability of wild fish stocks, which is obviously another important metric that we need to consider. We looked at what’s happening to global fish stocks earlier on this page. The impacts across the seafood products are shown in the charts. Here, we’re looking at the median across all of the assessed studies.20 These impacts are shown per kilogram of edible weight. That means we’re not including inedible parts such as shells or bones. Comparing fish to other types of fish is useful. But we also want to know how seafood compares to other protein foods. So, we’ve included chicken for comparison.21 Chicken tends to have the lowest environmental impact of meat and dairy products – much less than beef and lamb and a bit better than pork. So when we make this comparison, we’re really seeing how seafood compares to animal protein with the lowest impact. Overall, we see that a lot of seafood has a relatively low environmental impact compared to animal protein sources. Many types have a lower carbon footprint than chicken (those that are higher are around 20-30% higher). Most farmed seafood needs less land and freshwater and causes less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This is because fish tend to be more efficient than chickens in converting feed into meat, which means they need less feed per kilogram. There are some exceptions, though: wild flounder, lobster, and shrimp, for example, can have a high carbon footprint. More than double that of chicken. Related chart: Looking at the median footprints allows us to make quick, general assessments of the high- and lowest-impact species. However, they can hide the variability among a given species based on where and how it’s produced. This makes little difference for some species, but for others, it can have a large impact. In the chart, we see the spread of greenhouse gas emissions among the different types of seafood. The median of each – as we looked at above – is shown as the thick black line for each bar. The width of the bar shows us how variable this can be: it tells us what the largest and smallest impact can be for each species. Wild-caught seafood is shown in blue; farmed seafood is in red. Now we see that not only are there large differences in the median between each. There are also large differences in how variable emissions can be. In general, we tend to see that the impacts of farmed seafood are much less variable than wild-caught; the red bars are much thinner than the blue. Let’s take salmon as an example. The median emissions for farmed and wild-caught salmon are similar; farmed has a slightly lower footprint of 5.1 versus 6.9 kg CO2e per kg. But the big difference comes from the spread of emissions: wild-caught can range anywhere from 1.7 to 17 kg CO2e. That’s a ten-fold difference. Farmed salmon only ranges from 4.1 to 6.2 kg CO2e, a 50% difference between the minimum and maximum. If you choose wild-caught salmon, you could be picking a low-carbon or a high-carbon protein source. It might even be lower than farmed salmon. But if you pick farmed salmon, you are almost guaranteed that it will be relatively low-carbon. We see this across other species, too: see shrimp, for example. The same is true in our comparison to chicken. Chickens have a very low footprint variation. Wild-caught fish such as salmon or tuna can have a lower or higher footprint depending on where and how it’s caught. Some choices that will guarantee a relatively low footprint are farmed bivalves (mussels, oysters, and scallops) and seaweed – these are filter-feeding organisms that also sequester carbon and nutrients in their shells. That is partly why they have such low emissions, and they need no additional land either. Farmed salmon, trout, carp, and catfish are also good choices. What do these results tell us about how seafood fits into a sustainable diet? Again, we should be clear that the most effective way to reduce the impact of your diet is to eat less animal-sourced products overall. On the basis of total protein and calories, plant-based foods such as legumes and soy still have a much lower impact. However, for those who do not want to eliminate animal products completely, seafood can be a good choice. Many types of seafood have a lower impact than chicken. This means they have a much lower impact than foods such as beef or lamb. As we saw earlier on this page, the status of wild fish stocks is mixed. Effective management of fisheries across Europe and North America means that many of these fish stocks are stable and no longer in decline.11 Unfortunately, we know much less about the health of fish stocks across Asia and much of Africa, but many of these stocks are likely to be overfished. That matters for where you source wild-caught fish; sourcing from European or American fisheries might be a safer choice if you want to ensure they are sustainable. The issue of wild fish stock depletion is not an issue for farmed seafood. As these fish tend to also have a low carbon and land footprint, farmed fish can be a low-impact source of protein. Most of the fishing methods we use have some kind of environmental impact – whether it’s burning fuel in fishing boats, unintentionally catching fish or marine animals we don’t want (bycatch), or leaving behind remnants of fishing gear. But dredging – sometimes referred to as bottom trawling – has the largest negative impact. Bottom trawling drags a structure along the seabed – at various depths in the sediment, depending on the specific method – to dislodge organisms such as crustaceans. It’s an incredibly efficient way to catch seafood. That’s why it’s so common: one-quarter of the world’s fish are caught this way. But it usually comes at an environmental cost. In this section, we look at how much of the seafloor is trawled, what the consequences are, and what we can do to reduce its impacts. Let’s first look at the question of how much of the seafloor is affected by trawling. Improved satellite and GPS tracking technologies mean that scientists can now map trawling patterns at high resolution. In a paper published in Nature, Enric Sala and colleagues estimate that around 5 million square kilometers (km2) of seabed is trawled each year.22 In the chart below, I’ve put this into the context of the global seabed area as a whole. The total ocean seabed spans 361 million km2.23 That’s the top bar in the chart. Most of this is deep ocean, far from the world’s continents, and at depths that we rarely visit. Around 10% of the world’s seabed is shallower than 1000 meters – this threshold includes all of the world’s continental shelves and areas that we’d fish in. That means 37 million km2 of seabed is within our scope. That is shown by the second bar. Our 5 million km2 of trawled seabed – shown as the bottom bar – is therefore equal to around 13.5% of the explorable seabed. In the context of the total seabed area, it’s 1.4%. Many have compared this area to the Amazon Rainforest.24 To some extent, the areas do match: the Amazon rainforest spans approximately 5 million km2. But we should be careful about using this comparison. Trawling does not have the same impact as cutting down a primary rainforest. As we will soon see, trawling does kill a lot of life on the seabed, but recovery times can be very quick: in the order of a few months to years. When we cut down the primary rainforest, we lock ourselves into a recovery period of many decades. Maybe even longer. What’s also important to note is that the same areas are often trawled again and again.25 What this means is that it’s not a different 5 million km2 that’s trawled every year. If that were true, within five years, almost all of the shallow seabed would be trawled. Thankfully, that’s not the case. The extent of trawling varies a lot from region to region. In a study published in PNAS, Ricardo Amoroso and colleagues mapped the extent of trawling across different regions.26 They monitored the share of continental shelves – to a depth of 1000m – that was trawled at least once during a period of two to four years.27 Some regions – such as South Chile, Alaska, and the Australian shelves – experienced almost no trawling at all. Others experienced a lot. 80% of the continental shelf in the Adriatic Sea was trawled. 42% of the North Sea was trawled. One-quarter of the shelf in the Irish Sea was. You can see these rates by region here. Passing a trawl over the seabed can have quite a severe impact on the organisms that live there. How much of the biota is affected depends on a couple of factors, including the type of gear used, the type of sediment, and what lifeforms live there. We might imagine that a coral that sticks out from the seabed will be destroyed while organisms deeper in the sediment might survive. Researchers have carried out studies to see what impact trawling has on wildlife – either through experimental methods or observing real-world impacts. In an analysis published in PNAS, Jan Geert Hiddink and colleagues brought these experiments together to build a complete picture.28 The impact of trawling really depends on the type of method and gear that’s used. We see that in the chart below, which shows the impact of four types: otter trawling, beam trawling, towed dregs, and hydraulic dredging. On the y-axis, we have the share of organisms that are removed or killed by a single pass of a trawl over the seabed. On the x-axis, we have the depth of the ocean sediment that the trawl reaches. What we see clearly is that the deeper the trawl digs into the sediment, the more biota we kill. Otter trawls have the lowest impact: they dig just 2.4 centimeters into the sediment, and around 6% of organisms are lost. Beam trawls lose 14%. Towed dredges dig twice as deep, and one-fifth of organisms are killed off. The most damaging method is hydraulic dredging: it digs deep into the sediment at 16 centimeters, and 41% of organisms are destroyed as a result. Once this area has been affected by trawling, how long does it take for its biodiversity to recover? For the ecosystem to get back to its pre-trawling state takes a few years if it’s left alone. In their analysis, Hiddink and colleagues found average recovery times (where ‘recovery’ means getting back to 95% of pre-trawling biomass levels) in the range of 1.9 to 6.4 years. The differences here were dependent on the method used – the shallower otter trawls caused less damage and recovered more quickly than the deep hydraulic trawling – and the environmental context, such as the type of seabed. This finding was consistent with previous studies, finding recovery to be in the range of years [this study, for example, reports a 4-5 year recovery time across multiple commercial trawling sites].29 Several years might seem like a long time, but it’s actually pretty fast for an ecosystem to recover. This is why I don’t find the comparison between dredging and rainforest clearing to be a particularly helpful one. If we cut down the Amazon rainforest, it will be decades, if not centuries, before it gets back to its previous state. Thankfully, these seabed communities recover orders of magnitude more quickly. But, of course, they only recover if we leave them alone. How is bottom trawling changing across the world? Is it becoming more or less common? Globally, bottom trawling rapidly increased through the second half of the 20th century. But it has not changed much since the 1990s. We see this in the chart. What has changed is where bottom trawling is happening. Trawling rates were very high across Europe in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. However, growing concern about the depletion of wild fish stocks has led to a significant reduction in recent decades to allow populations to recover. The cases of the UK, Portugal, and Spain are shown in the chart. Portuguese catch from bottom trawling has fallen by 90% since the 1960s.30 In 2016, the European Commission also banned bottom trawling in deeper water below 800 meters. We see the same in Japan, where the catch peaked in 1972 at 4 million tonnes and has since fallen by around 90% to 400,000 tonnes. Bottom trawling has been growing elsewhere, though. It has been growing rapidly in China and India since the 1980s. Although these rates have stabilized – or even declined – in the last few years. Since most methods of trawling create environmental damage, you might suggest that the best option is to eliminate it completely. But in reality, it is still the most efficient method of catching seafood – which is why so many countries continue to use it. We can limit the use of trawling, which, in fact, many countries have. We just saw examples of this across Europe and Japan. But this will come at the cost of catch and income for communities that rely on it. If we can’t – or don’t want to – eliminate it completely, there are still things we can do to limit its impacts. The types of gear used for trawling can have very different impacts. Some are much more damaging than others. One option is, therefore, to ban specific types of gear rather than completely ban the practice. Another option is to modify the types of gear used to limit their damage to the seabed. For example, the doors on otter trawls are very destructive; newer designs now limit the amount of impact these doors have on the seafloor. In some cases, they eliminate this contact completely. Finally, we can ban trawling in specific locations where the habitat is particularly sensitive. For example, not allowing trawling in areas with coral reefs or important biodiverse habitats such as seagrasses. This would allow trawling activity to continue but would protect important areas of our ocean at the same time. Fish farming – also known as aquaculture – has boomed over the last 50 years. Production has increased more than 50-fold. In fact, we now produce more seafood from aquaculture than we do from wild catch. This has been good news for the health of global fish stocks. Global demand for seafood might have increased, but wild fish populations are finite. If we push beyond the limits of how quickly fish populations recover, this becomes unsustainable. Aquaculture has, therefore, been an ingenious solution: rather than relying on wild fish, we can produce our own. Nearly all of the growth in seafood production in recent decades has come from aquaculture; wild fish catch has changed very little. However, there has been one concern about the rise of aquaculture in relation to wild fish stocks. Like any type of animal farming, we need to feed them. Sometimes, we feed them fishmeal and fish oils. Not all aquaculture species are fed from animal sources, but many are. They don’t necessarily need fishmeal and oils in their diets, but fish farmers often use them because they provide an almost perfect balance of essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids. Many have questioned whether aquaculture is really the solution that it seems. If it is partly fed by wild fish, perhaps more fish farms means more pressure on wild fish stocks? Here, I take us through the numbers to understand how much wild fish catch really goes towards animal feed, how this is changing over time, and whether this undermines the benefits of aquaculture. Let’s first understand the amount of wild fish that is used as feed. In the chart, we see the breakdown of global fish catch in 2017.31 The world caught around 109 million tonnes of fish. 84% of this was used for direct human consumption. The remaining 16% was turned into fishmeal and oils to use as animal feed. 5% went to land-based livestock such as cows, pigs, and chickens. 11% went to aquaculture as feed for farmed fish. This bottom component is what we’re most interested in. In the second bar, we see global aquaculture production. We produce around 112 million tonnes of farmed seafood a year. We should be careful not to interpret this as the total input and output of feed for fish farming. It’s not the case that we put 12.6 million tonnes of feed in and magically get 112 million tonnes of fish back. That would massively overstate the efficiency of fish farms. First, fishmeal is just one of many things that we need to fish, so there are other inputs. Second, many aquaculture species are not fed fishmeal or oils at all. Only a small share of fish catch is used as feed for aquaculture today. However, aquaculture production has grown quickly. If we want to understand how sustainable this is, we need to know how the use of fish for feed has changed over time. In the chart, we see global fish catch since 1950.32  It is broken down by whether it is used for direct human consumption, animal feed, or other uses (which are mainly industrial uses of oils). First, we see that global fish catch has been relatively stable since 1990. If aquaculture was putting pressure on fish production, it’s not obvious from the total catch. When we look at the breakdown, we also see that the amount allocated to fishmeal and oil (animal feed) has not changed much since 1990. It increased a lot from the 1950s through to the 1980s. But since 1990, it has actually declined. This decline is seen even more clearly in this chart, which shows the amount of wild fish used as animal feed (in blue) and aquaculture production (in red).33 As we will see later, in its infancy, the aquaculture industry was inefficient. To produce one fish, you need several fish as feed inputs. That’s part of the explanation for why feed inputs in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s were higher than aquaculture production. Thankfully, aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has declined over the last few decades. This is for several reasons. First, the feed conversion and efficiency of fish farms have improved. Second, we’ve been discovering blends of plant-based ingredients that offer all of the essential nutrients; this reduces the need for fishmeal and oil. As we can see from the chart, aquaculture production increased by 250% between 2000 and 2015. Meanwhile, fish caught for feed actually declined. Aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has been weakening. It’s not the case that more and more aquaculture puts more and more pressure on wild fish. There’s one key metric that we need to understand: the efficiency of fish feed and the FIFO ratio. The Fish In: Fish Out (FIFO) ratio tells us how much fish we need to feed aquaculture species to get one fish back in return. If you have a FIFO greater than 1, you need more fish inputs than you get back from your fish farm. So a ratio of 2 means you need two fish equivalents of fishmeal and oil to be able to produce one fish in return. On the flip side, a ratio of 0.5 means you get two fish back from every fish you put in. In the chart here, we see the FIFO ratio across all of the most common aquaculture species.34 At the bottom, we see the total across all species fed by fishmeal. This shows the change in FIFO in the two decades from 1997 (the red markers) to 2017 (blue markers). In 1997, aquaculture used fish feed very inefficiently. The overall ratio was 1.9, meaning almost two fish were required as inputs to produce one fish in return. This has improved massively in the decades since then. In 2017, this ratio was 0.28: we got three fish back from one fish used as input.35 This improvement came from efficiency gains, as well as a switch to other plant-based feed blends. The FIFO improved for all aquaculture species. Today, this ratio for the most common species – carp, tilapia, and catfishes, shown at the top – is incredibly low. They use very tiny amounts of fishmeal as inputs. On the other hand, farmed salmon, trout, and eel still have unfavorable ratios. This has improved significantly in recent decades but is still well above 1. Hopefully, this ratio will continue to fall. Overall, aquaculture is an important solution to meet the growing demand for seafood. We cannot take endless numbers of wild fish from our oceans, so if we want more fish, we’re going to have to produce our own. A few decades ago, aquaculture’s benefits were questionable. But with massive improvements in efficiency, it is now a net producer of seafood. Fears that a growing aquaculture industry would put more and more pressure on wild fish stocks have not come true. When fishers go out to catch fish, it would be great if they only caught the fish that they need. If they’re fishing for tuna, they catch their daily quota of tuna and leave the rest of the ecosystem undisturbed. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Fishers also catch marine life that they don’t want. Catch that is not the species we’re targeting is called by-catch. Fishers sometimes bring by-catch back to land to eat or sell. But often, they will throw these unwanted fish back into the water. The animals they throw back are called discards. Discards can be dead or alive, but the survival rate is low. Some hardy shellfish might survive, but most discarded fish are dead. There are various reasons why fishers might not want these fish. They might be too small, inedible, damaged, or not give them a good return in the market. Fishers might also have strict quota restrictions on how much they can bring back each day. If they’re over the limit, they will have to throw some fish back. Discards are obviously negative. First, there is the obvious ethical lens of animal welfare – not only are we killing animals, but we’re killing them without an end use or purpose. Killing for no reason. Second, this is an issue that is often hidden from official statistics. Only ‘landings’ – the fish brought back to land – are recorded in most databases, such as those of the UN fisheries. Discards are not reported. It’s hard to understand fish stocks if large numbers of fish kills are going unmonitored. Maintaining sustainable fish stocks relies on us understanding how quickly fish populations regenerate and balancing this with how much fish we catch. Hidden catches could tip this out-of-balance. Thankfully, we are not completely blind. Marine scientists do reconstruct and estimate discards. The UN Fisheries Division also carries out periodic – around once every decade  – assessments to understand the magnitude of the problem. Globally, we throw less than a tenth of the fish and marine animals we catch back into the ocean. We see this in the chart, which shows global fish catch since 1950. This is split into ‘landings’ – catch that is brought back to land – and ‘discards’, the catch that is thrown back into the ocean. Researchers Dirk Zeller, Daniel Pauly, and Maria Palomares can reconstruct this data from estimates of how many discards are captured from different fishing methods.36 For example, the percentage of catch from bottom trawls that ends up being discarded. Their web platform – Sea Around Us – is an excellent resource for understanding global fisheries. The chart shows that the majority of the aquatic animals are brought ashore and used for human or animal consumption. The remaining amount is thrown back into the water. The UN Fisheries Division did an independent assessment of discards and found a similar result.37 It estimated that annual discards (averaged from 2010 to 2014) were around 9.1 million tonnes. That was 10.8% of the total catch. The amount of fish we discard has declined a lot in recent decades. We see this in the other chart, which shows plots that have been discarded since 1950. In the early 1950s, we were throwing around 5 million tonnes of fish away. This increased to 14 million tonnes in 1989. Since then, discards have fallen to around 8 or 9 million tonnes. This is back to levels in the late 1950s. Some fishing methods generate much more discards than others. You’re not going to generate the same unwanted catch using a fishing rod as you are from bottom trawling – dragging a large net along the seafloor. If you’re doing the latter, you’re going to end up with lots of unwanted animals in your net. It’s difficult to discriminate for the particular species that you want. Researchers gather data on how much catch is discarded when different types of fishing gear are used. This gives us what is called the discard rate – what percentage of the total catch is thrown back into the water. The average results across different fishing methods are shown in the chart. Unsurprisingly, trawling has the highest discard rate; half of the catch from shrimp trawls is thrown back in. The fact that trawling tends to have a high discard rate, and it is the method used to catch a lot of our fish, means that around half of global fish discards come from bottom trawling. There are no big winners when it comes to discards. Fish are killed needlessly, and the fact that these fish are not sold or eaten means that no one benefits from more income or food. Reducing discards is a good thing. As we saw earlier, discards have fallen since the 1990s. Why have they declined,  and can we learn to replicate it? One factor has been a rising market value of fish – even the species that fishers do not intend to catch. Fishers are, therefore, incentivized to bring more of their bycatch to land and sell it. That means that even if bycatch did not decline, the amount of discards would. Some countries have implemented a no-discard policy – a ban on discards at sea.37 This is sometimes called a ‘landing obligation’, which means that fishers must keep all of their caught fish on board and bring them back to land to declare as ‘landings’. This policy was implemented by the European Union and was a core part of its Common Fisheries Policy reform in 2013. If fishers have a quota or limit on how much fish they can catch, they have to be much more careful about by-catch – these unwanted fish will still count towards their quota for the day. Improved gear has led to much more selective fishing practices. Over time, gear has been adapted to reduce by-catch. Examples of this include changes in the size and shape of mesh and hook, adding ‘escape panels’ to trap nets, or the use of underwater lights or acoustic alarms.38 This has been shown to be effective in multiple contexts.39 Some countries – Belize is one example – go as far as to ban non-selective fishing gear completely.40 Many of the effective solutions to reduce discards rely on effective monitoring and enforcement of fishery policies. This means that countries that have been successful so far tend to be those with strong fisheries policies. Others lag behind, but there’s no reason to think that they could not do the same. Eliminating by-catch completely might be unrealistic. But the fact that discards have been falling means that we can do something about it. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are areas of ocean – which includes the water column and seafloor – that have been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment. Regulations in marine protected areas can vary but include interventions such as no fishing zones, restrictions on fishing such as the type of gear that can be used, bans or restrictions on activities such as mining, and regulations on inputs to the ocean from rivers and industrial effluents. How much of the world’s ocean is protected today? Here, we have to differentiate between national territorial waters – that is, parts of the ocean typically closer to coastlines that countries have national rights over – and international waters (also called the ‘high seas’) that do not belong to any single country. In the chart, we see the amount in each zone that is protected and unprotected.41 As of 2021, 7.7% of the total ocean is protected. This means 92% is unprotected. We see that much more of the world’s national waters are protected than international ones. In the charts here, we see the share of territorial waters that are protected in each country. This does not include international waters (‘high seas’). Schijns, R., Froese, R., Hutchings, J. A., Pauly, D., & Raicevich, S. (2021).

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,"Trio Flees Kuwait To Enter India Illegally By Fishing Boat, Arrested After Vessel Reaches Mumbai"," New Delhi: Mumbai police on Wednesday arrested three individuals from Tamil Nadu for allegedly entering India via a fishing vessel from Kuwait illegally, a development that has sparked concerns regarding potential lapses in maritime security, news agency PTI reported. According to a police spokesperson, the boat came under scanner off the Mumbai coast during routine patrols on Tuesday morning. Investigations revealed that the accused, identified as Vijay Vinod Anthony, Sahaya Antony Anish, both 29 and hailing from Kanyakumari, and Nidiso Dito, 31, from Ramnathpuram, were fishermen who had been working in Kuwait for the last two years. Allegedly mistreated by their employer, they took matters into their own hands, setting sail without authorisation in an attempt to flee the Gulf nation and surreptitiously entered Indian waters, PTI reported. Following their arrest, the individuals were remanded to police custody until February 10 by a local court. The incident has raised concerns about maritime security, echoing the fears prompted by the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, where Pakistani militants arrived via sea route, resulting in a devastating assault that claimed numerous lives. ""A suspicious boat was spotted by the officials of the Yellow Gate police station around 7.30 am on Tuesday when they were on patrolling duty in the Arabian Sea. The boat, which was of a different make, was found moving near the Sassoon Dock, following which the police patrolling boat went closer and found three persons aboard,"" the FIR stated, as reported by the news agency. Prompt coordination ensued, with the police alerting the South Region control room for reinforcements. Subsequently, additional police boats and a navy vessel were deployed to the scene. The suspects, failing to comply with instructions, had their boat towed to the Gateway of India for further investigation. During questioning, it emerged that the trio were fishermen, and the vessel belonged to their employer, Abdullah Sharahit, in Kuwait. However, they had absconded without authorization, breaching international borders and entering India illegally, sans passports. Formal charges were brought against them under Section 3(a) of the Passport (Entry into India) Rules for bypassing the requisite entry procedures. The Colaba police station registered a case against the offenders based on a complaint lodged by a 34-year-old constable from the Yellow Gate police station, PTI reported.",2024-02-07
Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,EXCLUSIVE: 55 Chinese sailors are feared dead after nuclear submarine 'gets caught in a trap intended to snare," By Mark Nicol, Defence Editor   Published:  12:25 EDT, 3 October 2023   |  Updated:  18:51 EDT, 3 October 2023      595 View  comments  Fifty-five Chinese sailors are feared dead after their nuclear submarine apparently got caught in a trap intended to ensnare British sub-surface vessels in the Yellow Sea. According to a secret UK report the seamen died following a catastrophic failure of the submarine's oxygen systems which poisoned the crew. The captain of the Chinese PLA Navy submarine '093-417' is understood to be among the deceased, as were 21 other officers. Officially, China has denied the incident took place. It also appears Beijing refused to request international assistance for its stricken submarine. Illustrative photo shows the Long, a nuclear submarine, during a naval parade in 2019. 55 reportedly died after a Chinese nuclear submarine got caught in a trap in the Yellow Sea   The UK report into the fatal mission reads: 'Intelligence reports that on 21st of August there was an onboard accident whilst carrying out a mission in the Yellow Sea. More than 100 Russian sailors died following an explosion aboard their nuclear submarine the Kursk in August 2000. The Kremlin initially denied reports about the incident and declined assistance from Britain and Norway until it was too late to save those still alive inside the stricken vessel. The Kursk remains the biggest disaster in the history of submarines with the loss of 118 lives. It was on an exercise in the Barents Sea when one of its torpedoes exploded as the crew were preparing for a test launch. The blast caused more torpedoes to detonate and sent the submarine to the sea bed. 'Incident happened at 08.12 local resulting in the death of 55 crew members: 22 officers, 7 officer cadets, 9 petty officers, 17 sailors. Dead include the captain Colonel Xue Yong-Peng. 'Our understanding is death caused by hypoxia due to a system fault on the submarine. The submarine hit a chain and anchor obstacle used by the Chinese Navy to trap US and allied submarines. 'This resulted in systems failures that took six hours to repair and surface the vessel. The onboard oxygen system poisoned the crew after a catastrophic failure.' As yet there is no independent confirmation of the suspected loss of the Chinese submarine in the public domain.  Beijing has dismissed open source speculation about the incident as 'completely false' while Taiwan has also denied internet reports. Mail Plus approached the Royal Navy to discuss the details contained in the UK report but official sources declined to comment or offer guidance. The UK report, which is based on defence intelligence, is held at a high classification. A British submariner offered this explanation: 'It is plausible that this occurred and I doubt the Chinese would have asked for international support for obvious reasons. 'If they were trapped on the net system and the submarine's batteries were running flat (plausible) then eventually the air purifiers and air treatment systems could have failed. 'Which would have reverted to secondary systems and subsequently and plausibly failed to maintain the air. Which led to asphyxia or poisoning. 'We have kit which absorbs co2 and generates oxygen in such a situation. It is probable that other nations do not have this kind of tech.' Xi Jinping toasts leaders and guests during an anniversary celebration of the PRC on September 28. China has officially denied the incident with the Type 093 submarine happened The Chinese Type 093 submarines entered service in the last 15 years. The vessels are 351ft-long and are armed with torpedoes. The Type 093s are among China's more modern submarines and are known for their lower noise levels. The sinking is understood to have taken place in waters off China's Shandong Province.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Google,"Despite Progress, Illegal Catch Continues to Reach the Market"," Navigate to: Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is one of the biggest threats to global ocean sustainability. Researchers estimate that at least 1 in 5 fish caught globally are caught illegally, with a total cost to coastal nations between U.S. $10 billion and $23 billion a year.1  The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA), in force since 2016, is the only legally binding international treaty specifically designed to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU-caught fish from entering the market.2 Parties to the PSMA must implement controls sufficient to minimize that risk to ensure that foreign fishing vessels landing or transshipping—that is, transferring fish or other marine wildlife between a fishing vessel and a carrier vessel—in ports do so legally. The agreement also requires that parties adopt similar controls for oversight of domestic fleets.  To identify gaps in PSMA implementation, The Pew Charitable Trusts commissioned a peer-reviewed study by researchers from Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management and Global Fishing Watch that was published in the journal Marine Policy in 2023.3 The research team used 2020 fishing and carrier vessel positional data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) and other publicly available information to rank coastal State fishing ports by various measures—including foreign vessel visits, fishing vessel hold size and carrier vessel hold size—and determine which States had the most risk of illegally caught fish entering the marketplace to identify the ports where effective PSMA implementation would have the greatest impact.  This research builds on a first-of-its-kind 2019 study that used 2017 AIS data to better understand fishing and carrier vessel movements and to identify the most-used ports and the risks for IUU-caught fish to be landed at them. That analysis also yielded a peer-reviewed paper published in the Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics in 2019.4 Now, this updated study includes an additional analysis of the use of designated ports— landing ports to which States direct foreign vessels to ensure application of sufficient controls—which is a key requirement of the PSMA.5 The latest findings demonstrate significant changes in the ranking of ports between the study years, mainly better AIS detection and track assessments, particularly of domestic fleets, changes in adoption and implementation of PSMA and port State measures (PSMs), and the impact of COVID-19-related port closures.6 The key findings were:  Overall, the study shows that simply being a party to the PSMA is highly effective in closing ports to illegal catch, and the analysis makes a strong case for more States to adopt the agreement. This brief provides a summary of the study findings and lays out key recommendations to help States implement the PSMA. In 2020, as in 2017, China was home to the top 10 ports in the world based on the total number of fishing and carrier vessel visits, with domestic vessels accounting for the majority of landings. (See Figure 1.) However, between those years, the ports used in China changed, and total vessel traffic increased 50%—most likely because AIS detection algorithms improved and the researchers used a different AIS provider that delivered more inshore data. The main focus of the PSMA is for States to place tighter controls on foreign-flagged vessels seeking to enter and use their ports to land or transship fish. So, in addition to analysing which ports had the highest overall vessel visits, the study identified where most foreign vessels may be landing their catch and which States have the largest fish capture capacity for fishing vessels and carrier vessels. The findings should help PSMA parties provide more targeted assistance to States seeking to implement effective port measures and minimize the risk of IUU fish entering the market. This analysis found that since the first study, the overall number of foreign vessel visits increased, and the ports visited changed significantly. (See Figure 2.) For instance, Nouadhibou, Mauritania, experienced a more than 100% increase in foreign vessel visits, changing the port’s ranking from fifth in 2017 to first in 2020. Most foreign fishing vessels landing in Nouadhibou were flagged to Turkey (930 visits), China (299), Spain (293) and Cameroon (183). Elsewhere, visits to Busan, South Korea, declined by slightly more than 10%, and the port dropped from first to second in the rankings, with the majority of visits from Russia, both fishing and carrier vessels (837 visits), China (178) and Panama (146).  In addition, many Pacific ports experienced significant decreases in vessel visits between 2017 and 2020 because of pandemic-related closures or restrictions. Foreign vessel visits fell by more than 40% in Majuro, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and over 50% in Suva, Fiji, dropping both ports out of the top 10. Other ports with significant decreases in visits that were probably driven by the pandemic include Manta, Ecuador (-78.4%), Kirkenes, Norway (-73.3%), Walvis Bay, Namibia (-51.3%), Port Louis, Mauritius (-48.7%), Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire (-35.9%) and Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia (-43.8%). The shifts in vessel visits were largely paralleled by changes in the hold sizes of visiting foreign fishing vessels between the two studies. (See Figure 3.) For instance, hold sizes of vessels visiting Nouadhibou increased three-fold in 2020 compared with 2017, while in Majuro, hold sizes declined by at least 60%. Port rankings by foreign carrier vessel hold size also changed considerably between the study years, although Busan remained number one. Several ports that were listed in 2017, mainly in the Pacific, fell out of the top rankings in 2020 because of pandemic-related restrictions, while ports in the Philippines, Europe and Japan joined the top 10 in 2020. Additionally, total carrier hold size increased by 56.8% between the study years. (See Figure 4.) Of the total vessel visits to ports (1,705,358) in 2020, most involved vessels entering domestic ports (1,655,429); only a small proportion (49,929) were vessels landing in foreign ports. The total vessel visit figure increased considerably from the 775,453 in the first study, probably as a result of advancements in AIS algorithm detection, particularly for domestic visits, which accounted for the vast majority of visits in both years, totalling 40,992 in 2017. As a result, just 2.9% of all 2020 port visits fell under the main provisions of the PSMA—which target foreign vessels—such as requiring the use of designated ports, advance notification of entry into port and risk assessment.7  Globally, European vessels made the most visits to foreign ports. Vessels from Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean made the second- and third-most foreign visits, respectively. (See Figure 5.) Vessels from the remaining regions made up less than 10% of the overall visits to foreign ports.  In relative terms, when considering foreign versus domestic visits by region, vessels from Latin America and the Caribbean (25.6%) made the most foreign port visits as a share of total visits, followed by those from the Southwest Pacific (15%), Africa (12.6%), the Near East (10.8%) and Europe (4.6%). (See Figure 6.) Asian (1.1%) and North American (0.8%) vessels had the lowest shares of foreign visits.  To assess the risk of IUU-caught fish passing through ports in each of the 140 coastal States, the researchers created an index that combines the level of vessel traffic at each port, as detected by AIS, with indicators of internal and external risk. (See Table 1.) For example, one indicator of internal risk is perceived levels of corruption, while visits by vessels likely to be engaged in IUU fishing is an indicator of external risk. Table 1 Underlying indicators for the Port State IUU Risk Index Note: “Fishing vessels” refers to fishing and carrier vessels.  * Status indicates whether the European Union (EU), United States (U.S.), or an RFMO mechanism has identified the port State as underperforming or issued a warning to that effect. † Average Transparency International Corruption Perception Index scores for the flag States of foreign vessels that entered given ports.

Hosch et al., “IUU Safe Havens or PSMA Ports: A Global Assessment of Port State Performance and Risk” (2023), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105751 The analysis scores and ranks port States based on internal, external and overall risk levels, with lower scores indicating lower risk. Internal risk scores capture the extent to which each country has measures in place to mitigate IUU risks, such as being a party to the PSMA. External risk scores reflect the IUU fishing histories of the vessels landing in each port. The overall risk score is an average of the internal and external scores.  The trend from 2017 to 2020 shows increasing risk in non-PSMA ports, which are experiencing more visits from foreign vessels flagged to States that are not parties to the agreement. Future analyses will better indicate whether the trends are significant.  Europe and North America were the the lowest-risk regions overall. (See Table 3.) Table 2  Global port State risk by type, year and percentage change, 2017 to 2020 Note: The overall risk score improved slightly (-0.5%) between studies, mainly because of improvements by States in mitigating the risk of IUU-caught fish landing in port (internal risk), while an increase in higher-risk vessel movements (external risk) posed the biggest threat.

Latin America and the Caribbean had the biggest change as a result of reduced mitigation measures at the State level (internal risk) and more high-risk vessels (external risk) landing in their ports. As of 2020, the Near East had the highest IUU risk in all risk categories. The internal risk score evaluates whether a country has measures in place to mitigate IUU risks. The external risk score evaluates risks associated with IUU fish-carrying vessels attempting to enter port. Source: G.

Where more than one State is listed, the scores for all listed States were equal. Sources: G. Hosch et al., “IUU Safe Havens or PSMA Ports: A Global Assessment of Port State Performance and Risk” (2023), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105751 The researchers used the 2020 risk score data to conduct a statistical analysis of potentially significant relationships between key variables: internal and external port State risk, internal and external risk scores between parties and non-parties to the PSMA, port States’ risk and their Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) scores, vessel flag State and port State CPI scores, and the overall port State IUU risk and per capita gross national income. Their analysis found that:  A key provision within the PSMA is for parties to designate ports where foreign vessels must land their catch. Designated ports have the appropriate facilities to conduct a risk assessment of foreign vessels requesting entry and require that vessels wishing to land supply all the information necessary to substantiate their catch. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s database of publicly hosted PSMA applications for designated ports showed that 32 States, including 18 in the EU, had selected and listed their designated ports as of 2020. For this study, the researchers analyzed those States’ designated port use and found that implementation varied substantially.8 The percentage of foreign vessels calling to non-designated EU ports in 2020 was 46.6%, or nearly 1 in 2. (See Table 5.) The lowest visits to designated ports were in Belgium (1.4%), France (16.8%), Greece (17.4%) and Portugal (25%). By comparison, Bulgaria and Lithuania used designated ports 100% of the time. Table 5 Designated port entry statistics for 18 EU countries, 2020 Note: European Union law does not require vessels from EU States to use designated ports. Source: G. Hosch et al., “IUU Safe Havens or PSMA Ports: A Global Assessment of Port State Performance and Risk” (2023), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105751 Among non-EU port States, 39.6% of foreign vessels did not use designated ports, with the lowest use of designated ports in Japan (38.1%), Norway (50.9%) and Iceland (66.5%), and the highest (100%) in Republic of The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Republic of The Maldives, São Tomé e Principe, Seychelles and Togo. (See Table 6.) These findings suggest that developing states are implementing the designated port provision more consistently and effectively than developed nations. However, developing countries may also have fewer facilities for offloading catch and lower levels of visits, which may be a factor in their higher use of designated ports. Table 6 Designated port entry statistics for 14 non-EU States, 2020 Notes: Designated port use outside of the EU improved slightly over the time covered by the 2020 data set, from 54.4% to 60.4%, with most developing States using them 100% of the time. Source: G. Hosch et al., “IUU Safe Havens or PSMA Ports: A Global Assessment of Port State Performance and Risk” (2023), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2023.105751 Parties to the PSMA have made progress minimizing the risk of IUU-caught fish landing in port. However, countries that either are not parties to the PSMA or have no PSMs in place face growing pressure as foreign vessels flagged to non-party nations increasingly seek access to ports with no controls. To better limit highrisk vessels’ access to their ports, lower-performing nations that already adhere to the PSMA must more stringently apply its provisions, and more non-party States must adopt and implement the agreement. In support of this goal, Pew offers four recommendations:  Although global port State risk improved slightly in 2020 compared with 2017, more progress is needed to implement PSMA provisions, especially designated port use, more effectively. As high-risk vessels seek ports with lax port controls, the tracking of vessels flagged to non-parties to the PSMA is important for assessing risk.  Additionally, domestic checks are vital because foreign vessel visits make up less than 3% of total visits. States need to prioritize more effective port controls for domestic fleets that meet the same standards applied to foreign vessels. Finally, being party to the PSMA or implementing effective PSMs is a useful deterrent against the risk of IUU-caught fish entering the market. Overall, this study demonstrates that the PSMA is highly effective and highlights the need for full global implementation of the agreement to minimize high-risk vessels’ opportunities to land illegal catch—and ultimately to end IUU fishing around the world.  This study builds on two previous assessments: Poseidon’s 2015, “Fish Landings at the World’s Commercial Fishing Ports,” which ranked the world’s top 100 ports by volume of commercial fish landed by industrialscale vessels, and the 2019 study by OceanMind and Poseidon, “Any Port in a Storm: Vessel Activity and the Risk of IUU-Caught Fish Passing Through the World’s Most Important Fishing Ports,” which combined AIS and other data to develop indicators of port risk.  For this latest study, Poseidon and Global Fishing Watch analysed AIS records from 2020 and created a global data set of 166,514 anchorage points. They then aggregated those points into ports and identified when a fishing vessel and a carrier vessel “enters” an anchorage—having an AIS position within 3 km of an anchorage point—and “exits”—having a position more than 4 km from an anchorage point. To avoid recording port entries in cases when vessels simply transited near anchorages (meeting the basic entry and exit criteria), two additional events were recorded: anchorage stops and anchorage gaps. A port stop begins when a vessel is within 3 km of an anchorage point (“in port”) with a speed less than 0.2 knots and ends when the vessel speed exceeds 0.5 knots. These stops were algorithmically grouped to represent port visits and linked to locations that represent commonly used ports and anchorages.  Given the variable satellite coverage and AIS use and data quality, this analysis does not capture every fishing vessel or even all of those fitted with functioning AIS transponders.  Trygg Mat Tracking carried out a quality assurance review of a subset of the data for ports and anchorages. That review identified that some events were inappropriately associated with a specific anchorage or port, and researchers may have overcounted port visits at the State level. The research team corrected some of these errors, but overall, the issues probably had a minimal impact on the global analysis because their effects tend to cancel out over larger areas. The ranking of ports, especially those based on vessel hold sizes, must be used carefully and for comparative purposes only, because the values are estimates. The rankings based on hold size are of great interest because they represent the aggregate potential for loading, unloading or transshipment of fish, but they should not be interpreted as estimates of the volume of landings or transshipment in port. Of the 153 coastal States initially selected for this study, researchers eliminated 13 because they detected no AIS-fitted fishing vessels entering ports: Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Comoros, Eritrea, Haiti, Jordan, Monaco, Nauru, Niue, Syria and Timor-Leste. Of the 140 coastal States identified as operating fishing ports based on AIS data, two did not have any visits by foreign AIS-detected vessels (Bahrain and Nicaragua). Some of the eliminated coastal States—for example, Cambodia and Comoros—are clearly port States, and their exclusion demonstrates some of the limitations associated with the low rate of AIS technology use throughout fishing fleets globally. The non-AIS source data used for the risk indicators is of reliable quality, as determined by the processes applied by the individual organizations producing and hosting the data. When the researchers found discrepancies between the style or content of information from different sources, they took a conservative bias to ensure that countries received the most accurate possible scores. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) catch continues to enter world markets, accounting for up to $23.5 billion worth of seafood each year. To combat this illicit activity, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Agreement on Port State Measures (PSMA) came into force in 2016 after it surpassed 25 ratifications.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Bing,"Man declared dead after injury on fishing vessel off North Lake, P.E.I.",,1 hour ago
Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Bing,"FWC Law Enforcement Report: Derelict Vessel, Fishing Violation"," June 6, 2024  The Florida FWC Division of Law Enforcement reported the following recent activity: ESCAMBIA COUNTY Officer McHenry located the owner of a large vessel that washed ashore near the Garcon Point Bridge and issued him a notice to appear for a derelict vessel violation. The owner had received numerous citations for at-risk vessel violations in the last year but was unable to keep his vessel anchored and in operable condition. SANTA ROSA COUNTY Officers Bower and Brown were on patrol in Blackwater River and observed a vessel operating without proper navigation lights.  A vessel stop was conducted. The owner of the vessel had an active warrant and was arrested and transported to Santa Rosa County Jail. Officers Bower and Wilkerson were on patrol near Blackwater River and received a call of a juvenile operating a personal watercraft (PWC) in a careless manner. The officers attempted to stop them by initiating blue lights and sirens, the subjects continued navigating down the river at a high rate of speed in a no wake zone. The subjects appeared to be operating in a manner to avoid the officers. The officers navigated to the boat ramp and made contact with the subjects and addressed several violations. It was determined the father allowed his 9-year-old son to operate the PWC by himself. The father was issued a notice to appear for the violations. Officer Brown was on patrol conducting resource and license inspections when he observed two individuals fishing at a local boat ramp. Upon inspection, neither of the subjects had a valid fishing license and one of the subjects had his fishing rights suspended for over a year. Both subjects were cited appropriately. Officers Bower and Brown were on patrol when they observed a subject throwing a cast net in freshwater. The officers observed the subject catch a fish with his cast net and throw the fish in his vessel. The officers proceeded to conduct a boating and resource inspection on the vessel and the officers found multiple violations with the vessel including the vessel did not have a HIN number attached. The officers also located a bream the subject caught with his cast net. Upon interview, the subject admitted to catching the bream with his cast net. The subject was also found to be fishing on a suspended fishing license. The subject was cited appropriately. This report represents some events the FWC handled during the time period; however, it does not include all actions taken by the Division of Law Enforcement. Information provided by FWC.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Bing,Two Vessels Catch Fire After Missile Strikes off Yemen," 


June 9, 2024

 © lesniewski / Adobe Stock Two ships caught on fire after being hit by projectiles off Yemen's Aden, two UK maritime agencies reported on Sunday. The British security firm Ambrey said on Sunday an Antigua- and Barbuda-flagged general cargo ship was struck by a missile 83 nautical miles southeast of Aden and caught fire. The fire was later contained. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said it had received a report from a captain of a vessel of an incident 80 nautical miles southeast of Aden. ""The ship was heading southwest along the Gulf of Aden at a speed of 8.2 knots when the forward station was struck by a missile. A fire started but was neutralised,"" Ambrey said in an advisory note. ""A second missile was sighted but did not hit the ship. Persons on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident."" Ambrey said the ship changed course to port and increased speed, adding that ""no injuries were reported."" Separately, Ambrey and UKMTO said they had received a report about another incident 70 nautical miles southwest of Aden. ""The master reports that the vessel was hit by an unknown projectile on the aft section, which resulted in a fire. Damage control is underway,"" UKMTO said in advisory note. They added that no casualties were reported and the vessel was proceeding to its next port of call. The Houthi militia, which controls the most populous parts of Yemen and is aligned with Iran, has attacked ships off its coast for months, saying it is acting in solidarity with Palestinians fighting Israel in Gaza. Houthi fighters have launched drone and missile attacks in the Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden, forcing shippers since November to take longer and more costly journeys around southern Africa. The United States and Britain have carried out strikes against Houthi targets in response to the attacks. The UKMTO said on Sunday that it had received a report of a missile attack on a merchant vessel 89 nautical miles southwest of Yemen's port city of Aden. ""Reporting suggests that the vessel has been hit,"" an advisory note from UKMTO said, but added that the vessel did not sustain any casualties and that it was proceeding to its next port of call.

Vessel caught with incorrect catch reports,Bing,"‘Colorum’ fishing boat catches fire, 6 crew members killed"," THE owner of the fishing boat that caught fire while sailing in the waters off Naga City, southern Cebu on Wednesday evening, June 5, 2024, was involved with colorum operations, making it ineligible for a marine protest, an official of the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Cebu said. Petty Officer First Class Joel Baring of the PCG substation in the City of Naga, in an interview on Thursday, June 6, said the fishing boat, King Bryan, lacks a permit to operate and thus cannot be suspended by the Maritime Industry Authority (Marina). A marine protest is a declaration on oath by the vessel’s master “of the circumstances attending the damage or loss of his vessel, intended to show that the loss occurred by the perils of the sea, and concluding with a protestation against any liability of the owner to the freighters.” The fishing vessel caught fire in the waters off the City of Naga around 8 p.m. on Wednesday, killing six of the 12 crew members, all from Masbate. Baring said the bodies of six crew members of the King Bryan fishing boat have already been retrieved. The fatalities were identified as Boyboy Bacolod, 29; Ariel Codilla, 37; Jonathan Sullano, 34; Onjing Conel, 41; Dominic Cleret, 18; and Joseph Sullano. The remaining six crew members were rescued, namely, Alvin Quiñones, 21; John Cloud Canones, 20; Alan Aviles, 18; Michael Bacas, 34; Miguel Cortes, 32; and boat captain Mark Anthony Sullano. Three of the survivors are currently confined at the Cebu South General Hospital, while the three other survivors were brought to the Coast Guard Sub-Station Naga for investigation. According to Baring, based on the initial investigation, a secondary engine that allegedly exploded caused the fire. Authorities are still identifying the owners of the vessel. According to Marina Circulars, sea vessels operating without the required permits will be sanctioned with a fine ranging from P10,000 to P100,000 depending on the size of the vessel. Baring said the penalty of the vessel depends upon the category to which it belongs in accordance with the Marina circular. In the King Bryan’s case, Baring believed it belonged to the fishing category. He said they will finish towing the wreckage of the fishing banca on Thursday. / JPS, DVG, TPT Follow Us ©Copyright 2024 SunStar Publishing Inc. Powered by Quintype",13 days ago

 Two ships caught on fire after being hit by projectiles off Yemen's Aden, two UK maritime agencies reported on Sunday. The British security firm Ambrey said on Sunday an Antigua- and Barbuda-flagged general cargo ship was struck by a missile 83 nautical miles southeast of Aden and caught fire. The fire was later contained. Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said it had received a report from a captain of a vessel of an incident 80 nautical miles southeast of Aden. ""The ship was heading southwest along the Gulf of Aden at a speed of 8.2 knots when the forward station was struck by a missile. A fire started but was neutralised,"" Ambrey said in an advisory note. ""A second missile was sighted but did not hit the ship. Persons on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident."" Ambrey said the ship changed course to port and increased speed, adding that ""no injuries were reported."" Separately, Ambrey and UKMTO said they had received a report about another incident 70 nautical miles southwest of Aden. ""The master reports that the vessel was hit by an unknown projectile on the aft section, which resulted in a fire. Damage control is underway,"" UKMTO said in advisory note. They added that no casualties were reported and the vessel was proceeding to its next port of call. The Houthi militia, which controls the most populous parts of Yemen and is aligned with Iran, has attacked ships off its coast for months, saying it is acting in solidarity with Palestinians fighting Israel in Gaza. Houthi fighters have launched drone and missile attacks in the Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden, forcing shippers since November to take longer and more costly journeys around southern Africa.

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Google,How disappearing ships could hold the clue to stopping illegal fishing," Sign in On an early January afternoon, a South Korean fishing boat, the Oyang 77, departed from Montevideo, Uruguay, for the plentiful waters off the coast of Argentina. A month later, it would be apprehended by the coast guard for illegal fishing. As it intruded into Argentinaâs territorial waters, the boat left a telltale digital signature, one that could be used to catch outlaw fishermen across the planet.  The Oyang 77 headed out to sea before turning southwest to track the Argentinian coast. On Jan. 10, 2019, it turned off its location transponder and disappeared. Over the next 17 days, the vessel disabled its transponder eight more times. Its precise whereabouts during the gaps in its location data are unknown. Finally, on Feb. 7, the Oyang 77 reappeared and made a beeline for Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina. It was escorted by the coast guard, under arrest for illegally fishing in Argentinian waters. Commercial fishermen regularly disable their location transponders, sometimes for innocent reasons, but often to hide illegal activity. Researchers and government officials say the gaps in transponder data can be used to track illegal fishing â and to fight back.  Todayâs high seas are a bit like the Old West: a wilderness too vast to police, offering riches to those with a tolerance for danger and, sometimes, a dubious commitment to the law. A stark reality confronts anyone who seeks to rein in bad behavior on the ocean: it is very, very big. To pinpoint where in the haystack to search for needles, a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers called Global Fishing Watch collects data from fishing boatsâ Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders, whose signals are picked up by satellites and land-based receivers. Recently, the team at Global Fishing Watch had a novel idea: instead of looking for where fishing boats broadcast their positions, what if they looked for where they hid them? âThe AIS data tells us a lot, but the absence of it does as well,â Tyler Clavelle, a data scientist at Global Fishing Watch, told me. Together with scientists from the University of California at Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries, Global Fishing Watch analyzed more than 28 billion AIS signals from 2017 to 2019. The researchers identified more than 55,000 gaps in the data and discovered that disabled transponders hide about 6 percent of the globeâs commercial fishing activity. Gaps in transponder data, 2017-2019 Fewer More NORTH AMERICA Africa’s west coast is a hotspot for piracy and illegal fishing.

ASIA NORTH AMERICA Chinese-flagged boats often don’t report catch in the Northwest Pacific. Africa’s west coast is a hotspot for piracy and illegal fishing. AFRICA SOUTH AMERICA Illegal fishing has been reported near the Galapagos and off Peru. AUSTRALIA The boundary along Argentina’s Exclusive Economic Zone showed the highest volume of data gaps. Fishing boats often hide their signals on the edge of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) boundaries, where countries have the right to exploit the resources within 200 nautical miles off their shoreline. Thatâs just what the Oyang 77 did in early 2019 when it vanished and reappeared near the boundary of Argentinaâs EEZ. The South Korean-flagged trawler belonged to the fleet operated by the Sajo Oyang corporation, notorious for its record of high seas transgressions, as documented by The Guardian. In recent years, the Oyang 77 had gotten in trouble in New Zealand for illegally dumping dead fish overboard, underreporting catch and failing to pay workers, according to a report from Oceana, a nonprofit focused on ocean conservancy. In February 2019, the Argentine Coast Guard discovered the trawler with its nets extended inside the EEZ. They found more than 310,000 pounds of seafood on board. Leaving nothing to chance, they deployed a helicopter and an airplane to assist the Coast Guard in escorting the Oyang 77 to shore, releasing it after confiscating its fishing equipment and extracting a fine of 25 million Argentine pesos, or about $550,000. Sajo Oyang did not respond to multiple requests to comment. Global Fishing Watchâs data did not help catch the Oyang 77, but patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and Canadaâs Department of Fisheries and Oceans already make use of it to decide which boats to pursue. Countries inspecting fishing boats in port can use Global Fishing Watchâs analytical tools to narrow their search. âYou can look up a vessel and see a history of its activity and quickly filter out vessels that appear to be operating above board, or identify vessels that have big gaps in their data or are operating in ways that are suspicious,â Clavelle said. Using shipsâ AIS data to enforce illegal fishing laws is not as easy as it sounds. AIS is not universally mandated aboard commercial fishing boats. Many fleets, including U.S. fishing boats, are tracked with a separate technology called the Vessel Monitoring System, which is visible to authorities but hidden from other vessels. AIS was created in the 1990s as a way to keep oil tankers from crashing. In the 2000s, private companies began launching satellites that could capture AIS signals from space, and a new industry emerged to supply government agencies with shipsâ location data. Yet even law-abiding fisherman sometimes wish to hide their location, either to conceal good fishing spots from competitors or to avoid capture in waters where pirates lurk. âWe thought we might have a pure illegal fishing story,â said Heather Welch, a NOAA affiliate and marine biologist at UC Santa Cruz, who led the research with Global Fishing Watch. âAnd it became very clear that thatâs not fair to the fishermen, that thatâs not the story weâre seeing here.â The researchers used a method of machine learning to separate the innocent AIS disabling from the nefarious. For instance, behavior that could have looked like statistical noise appeared to the researchersâ computer program as âloitering,â when boats with disabled transponders were motionless long enough to offload their catch to giant floating refrigerators called reefers. This is not always illegal, but it can be a way for boats with illegal catch to get rid of the evidence. âItâs a way to launder illegally caught seafood into the supply chain,â Welch told me. That makes it harder to know whether the fish at the grocery store was caught legally or not. The analysis could help coast guards pinpoint where and when illegal transshipment is likely to take place. Some in the fishing industry say that the rise of farmed seafood will reduce the opportunities for illegal fishing. The share of seafood from aquaculture grew from 6 percent in 1960 to 58 percent today, according to figures from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. That share is likely to keep rising, said Gavin Gibbons, vice president of communications at the National Fisheries Institute, an industry lobby. âThereâs only going to be more farmed going forward. Period. End of story,â Gibbons told me. âFarming will have to increase in order to feed a growing planet.â Yet aquaculture has only kept pace with the growth in seafood consumption and has not replaced wild caught seafood. Since the 1990s, wild seafood catch has stayed steady at about 100 million tons per year. In short, fish farming has not lowered the pressure on wild marine life. Even if aquaculture continues to grow, there will always be demand for wild caught fish, which many people prefer to the farmed variety. If aquaculture is not the solution to overfishing on the high seas, perhaps technology is. Global Fishing Watch and allies like Oceana, which co-founded the project in 2015, have pushed to require AIS on more commercial fishing boats. Global Fishing Watchâs next goal is to learn to detect fishing boats directly from satellite imagery, which would reveal far more activity than AIS signals alone. âWhat gets monitored gets managed,â Clavelle told me. âSo if you canât see whatâs happening on the ocean, how do you expect to manage it properly?â Programming note: I am grateful to my teammates, especially Niko Kommenda, for polishing up this column while I was off becoming a dad this week.

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Google,"Thousands of endangered sharks slaughtered by overfishing, new report reveals"," (Amsterdam) Activists from Greenpeace International confronted a fishing vessel yesterday around 200 miles away from The Azores as it was hauling in sharks on a longline, capturing shocking footage of their practices [see here]. The peaceful protest saw activists unfurl a banner with the message “Sharks Under Attack” and came as Greenpeace International releases a new report that reveals lack of protection in international waters is resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of endangered sharks each year.  In the North Atlantic, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza documented fishing vessels which, while known to be primarily catching swordfish, in fact collectively catch four times more sharks than swordfish (by weight).[1] During the protest, the crew saw only one swordfish being caught by the Spanish vessel Ameal and at least 8 sharks pulled from a line nearly 40 miles long. The shark species are currently being identified.  “It is absolutely immoral to kill sharks and other wildlife with these terrible fishing practices. We are exposing the culprits at sea now, but we urgently need a strong treaty and tighter fishing limits to protect our global oceans,” said Will McCallum, of Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign, on board the Esperanza. The report also highlights the devastating impact that overfishing is having on shortfin mako shark populations, the world’s fastest shark, which is closely related to the great white. Greenpeace’s analysis shows that Spanish and Portuguese ships in the area are catching as many as 25,000 mako sharks annually.[2]  The vessels follow migratory routes of swordfish, using destructive methods like kilometre long lines with thousands of hooks, which also kill sharks and other animals. Sharks are mainly targeted for their fins, which some cultures prize as a delicacy. An estimated 100 million sharks are killed every year.[3] Greenpeace analysis shows that, despite official estimates that immediately stopping all catch of shortfin mako would result in only a 50% chance of their population recovering by 2040, the most recent catch data was 3,112 tonnes in 2017, equating to as many as 25,000 endangered sharks.[4] The report is launched as the Esperanza sails from the Arctic to the Antarctic undertaking ground-breaking research and investigations to campaign for a strong Global Ocean Treaty at the United Nations. A strong treaty could pave the way for the creation of ocean sanctuaries in 30% of the high seas by 2030, placing vast areas of the sea off-limits to harmful human activities and allowing marine life to recover.  Today there is no legal mechanism to create ocean sanctuaries in international waters and only around 1% of the oceans are fully protected. Alongside the widespread failure of industry and regional bodies to stick to scientific advice, this enables the fishing industry to devastate marine ecosystems by using harmful practices to overfish, often in sensitive areas, and decimate shark populations worldwide. Many species of sharks are in danger of extinction and some populations have decreased by as much as 99% due to human activity.[5][6] Lifelong UK fisherman Jerry Percy, who has represented small–scale, sustainable fishermen across Europe, was on board the Esperanza and said:  “Smaller scale fishermen rely on healthy populations of sharks and other fish species at the top of the food chain to maintain the balance of marine life in the oceans. This allows us to make a sustainable living and at the same time support vulnerable coastal communities. But unregulated and lawless fishing is putting all this at risk, for short term profit for the few but long term losses for the many.” Greenpeace’s McCallum added, “people all over the world need healthy oceans to survive as much as the creatures that live in them. It’s time for us to cover the high seas with marine protected areas and give our blue planet a chance to recover.”  -30- Photo and video from North Atlantic fishing and other harmful fishing practices available here.

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Google,"Ocean fish catches 50% higher than reported, study suggests"," Humans are scooping millions of tonnes more fish out of the oceans than official statistics show — about 50 per cent more, estimates a new Canadian study that sheds some light on the extent of the problem and on who's catching all those extra fish. Statistics compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and cited by the study show that global marine catches between 1950 and 2010 peaked in 1996 at 86 million tonnes before declining by around 0.38 million tonnes per year. But by scouring out and including unreported catches around the world, the new study by Daniel Pauly and Dirk Zeller at the University of British Columbia and their 400 global collaborators with the Sea Around Us project estimates that the peak catch in 1996 was actually 51 per cent higher — 130 million tonnes, and has been declining by 1.2 million tonnes a year. The FAO statistics are based on numbers reported by individual countries, based on their own statistics, which include mainly industrial fishing catches. ""Countries have the bad habit of reporting only what they see,"" Pauly said in a teleconference organized by Nature Communications, the journal that published the study today. If they don't have the data for certain types of fishing, they report that zero tonnes are caught by that method. ""The result of this … is a systematic underestimation of catch. This can be very high,"" Pauly added — up to 20 to 30 per cent in developed countries or up to 200 to 300 per cent for some smaller island states. ""Here we show that the main trend of the world marine fisheries catches is not one of 'stability' as cautiously suggested earlier by FAO, but one of decline,"" the researchers wrote in their paper. ""Moreover, this decline, which began in the mid-1990s, started from a considerably higher peak catch than suggested by the aggregate statistics supplied by FAO members, implying that we have more to lose if this decline continues."" But that's not entirely bad, Pauly said, because it means the oceans are more productive than thought and conservation and good fisheries management may have better results than anticipated. ""If we rebuild stocks, we can rebuild to more than we thought before,"" he said. But the shortcomings of the FAO statistics are a challenge for international groups like the World Health Organization that rely on them to guide the development and implementation of projects. ""They are the ones who suffer most from this information being false, being misleading,"" Pauly said in an interview with CBC News. ""Unreported fisheries have an enormous impact on the stocks in countries where they operate."" The study suggests that all UN databases should be periodically evaluated ""to ensure they avoid producing poor numbers."" In response to the study, the FAO noted that its objective was to produce consistent data based on official statistics and common standards, which is not the same as the objective of the study. ""Users can utilize the official data and apply correction factors, as has been done in this paper and others,"" it added in a statement. It noted that the study would have been impossible without FAO data. The missing catch in FAO data includes fish caught by a lot of small-scale or ""artisanal"" fisheries, subsistence fishing, sport fishing and illegal fisheries. ""Because we're dealing with states, you can't say, you have an illegal fishery in the country, even if everyone knows it,"" Pauly said. It also includes ""bycatch,"" fish that are caught inadvertently and dumped by fleets targeting other species, such as shrimp. That was found to be a problem for the Atlantic cod off Canada's East Coast, and one of the factors preventing the stocks from recovering for many years, despite a moratorium on commercial fishing since 1992. ""Lots of small cod were being thrown away,"" Pauly said. ""To the cod, it doesn't matter whether they're targeted or not."" One stock, the northern cod, was recently found to have made a good recovery, but not enough to allow fishing to resume, and recovery for other stocks is still years away. The new study summarizes some of the findings of 200 smaller studies by 400 collaborators in countries around the world. Researchers from those countries looked for specific gaps in local catch data and tried to fill them. About a third of those studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals so far, Pauly said, while the rest — including the Canadian one, are considered papers in progress. ""For every country, there was a peculiar story to find and it was found,"" Pauly said. For example: The FAO expressed some concern about the study's methodology. ""In particular, calculating trends from the highest point in the series, and omitting the most recent years, leads to a high probability of a declining trend,"" it wrote. ""In spite of the technical reservations on the trends, FAO agrees with the basic conclusions of the paper: catch statistics (including estimates of additional sources of removals) can and should be improved, and this requires additional funding and international collaboration and country commitment.""

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Google,China's Fishing Operations Raise Alarms Worldwide," By Steven Lee Myers, Agnes Chang, Derek Watkins and Claire FuSept. 26, 2022 With its own coastal waters depleted, China has built a global fishing operation unmatched by any other country.  Rich and ecologically diverse, the waters around the Galápagos Islands have attracted local fishermen for centuries. Now, these waters face a much larger, more rapacious hunter: China. Chinese fishing in ⬤ 2020 and ⬤ 2021. The Galápagos are part of Ecuador. And yet each year growing numbers of Chinese commercial ships, thousands of miles from home, fish here, at times right on the edge of Ecuador’s  exclusive economic zone. The Chinese ships since 2016 have operated off South America virtually all day, all year, moving with the seasons from the coasts of Ecuador to Peru … … and eventually to Argentina, where they have fished for what amounts collectively to more than 16,000 days already this year. The scale has raised alarms about the harm to the local economies and the environment, as well as the commercial sustainability of tuna, squid and other species. 
	Over the last two decades, China has built the world’s largest deep-water fishing fleet, by far, with nearly 3,000 ships. Having severely depleted stocks in its own coastal waters, China now fishes in any ocean in the world, and on a scale that dwarfs some countries’ entire fleets near their own waters.
 
	The impact is increasingly being felt from the Indian Ocean to the South Pacific, from the coasts of Africa to those off South America — a manifestation on the high seas of China’s global economic might.
 
	The Chinese effort has prompted diplomatic and legal protests. The fleet has also been linked to illegal activity, including encroaching on other countries’ territorial waters, tolerating labor abuses  and catching endangered species. In 2017, Ecuador seized a refrigerated cargo ship, the Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999, carrying an illicit cargo of 6,620 sharks, whose fins are a delicacy in China.
 
	Much of what China does, however, is legal — or, on the open seas at least, largely unregulated. Given the growing demands of an increasingly prosperous consumer class in China, it is unlikely to end soon. That doesn’t mean it is sustainable.
 
	In the summer of 2020, the conservation group Oceana counted nearly 300 Chinese ships operating near the Galápagos, just outside Ecuador’s exclusive economic zone, the 200 nautical miles off its territory where it maintains rights to natural resources under the Law of the Sea Treaty. The ships hugged the zone so tightly that satellite mapping of their positions traced the zone’s boundary.
 
	Together, they accounted for nearly 99 percent of the fishing near the Galápagos. No other country came close.

	“Our sea can’t handle this pressure anymore,” said Alberto Andrade, a fisherman from the Galápagos. The presence of so many Chinese vessels, he added, has made it harder for local fishermen inside Ecuador’s territorial waters, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that inspired Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution.
 
	Mr. Andrade has organized a group of fishermen, the Island Front for the Galápagos Marine Reserve, to call for the expansion of fishery protections around the islands.
 
	“The industrial fleets are razing the stocks, and we are afraid that in the future there will be no more fishery,” he said. “Not even the pandemic stopped them.”
 
	China can fish on such an industrial scale because of vessels like Hai Feng 718, a refrigerated cargo ship built in Japan in 1996. It is registered in Panama and managed by a company in Beijing called Zhongyu Global Seafood Corporation.
 
	Its owner is a state-owned enterprise: the China National Fisheries Corporation.
 
	Hai Feng 718 is known as a carrier vessel, or mothership. It has refrigerated storage holds to preserve tons of catch. It also carries fuel and other supplies for smaller ships that can unload their hauls and resupply their crews at sea. As a result, the other vessels do not need to spend time returning to port, allowing them to fish almost continuously.
 
	Over the course of a year beginning June 2021, the Hai Feng 718 met at least 70 smaller Chinese-flagged fishing vessels in various locations at sea, according to Global Fishing Watch, a research organization that assembles location data from ship transponders. Each encounter, known as a transshipment, represents the transfer of tons of fish that the smaller ships would have had to unload in port hundreds of miles away.
 
	Together the vessels followed the coasts of South America in what has become a year-round pursuit of catch.
  
	After leaving Weihai, a port town in China’s Shandong Province, the Hai Feng 718 arrived in the Galápagos in August 2021 and spent nearly a month in the waters off Ecuador’s exclusive economic zone. There it serviced numerous ships like the Hebei 8588.
 
	Such vessels are designed for catching squid, one of the prizes for the fleet. The lights the ships use at night to lure squid to the surface are so bright they can be tracked from space.
 
	A month later, the Chinese fleet traveled to the coast of Peru, where the Hai Feng 718 sidled up to more than two dozen smaller vessels, some of them multiple times, including, again, the Hebei 8588.
 
	Loaded with catch, the mothership returned to China. By last December, it was at sea again, this time heading west through the Indian Ocean. It arrived off the coast of Argentina for the start of the squid season there in January. In May, it was once again off the coast of the Galápagos.

	These operations have allowed a boom in the squid harvest. Between 1990 and 2019, the number of deep-water squid boats soared from six to 528, while the annual reported catch rose from about 5,000 tons to 278,000, according to a report this year by Global Fishing Watch. In 2019, China accounted for nearly all the squid boats operating in the South Pacific.
 
	The arrangement of transferring catch to another vessel is not illegal, but according to experts, the use of the motherships makes it easy to underreport the catch and disguise its origins. Other places also deploy deep-water fleets, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, but none do so on the scale of China.
 
	The Hai Feng 718 alone has more than 500,000 cubic feet of cargo space, enough to carry thousands of tons of fish.

	Global Fishing Watch has tracked scores of unexplained “loitering events,” where larger ships linger in one area without any recorded meetings between the carriers and smaller ships. Experts warn that the smaller ships may be turning off their transponders to avoid detection to disguise illegal or unregulated catch.
 
	The impact on certain species like squid off the coast of South America is difficult to measure exactly. In some regions, like the South Pacific, international agreements require countries to report their haul, though underreporting is believed to be common. In the South Atlantic, there is no such agreement.
 
	There are already worrisome signs of diminishing stocks, which could foreshadow a broader ecological collapse.
 
	“The concern is the sheer number of ships and the lack of accountability, to know how much is being fished out and where it’s going to,” said Marla Valentine, an oceanographer with Oceana, the conservation group. “And I’m worried that the impacts that are happening now are going to cascade into the future.
 
	“Because it’s not just the squid that are going to be affected,” she added. “It’s going to be everything that feeds on the squid, too.”
 
	The appearance of the Chinese fleet on the edge of the Galápagos in 2020 focused international attention on the industrial scale of China’s fishing fleet. Ecuador lodged a protest in Beijing. Its president at the time, Lenín Moreno, vowed on Twitter to defend the marine sanctuary, which he called “a seedbed of life for the entire planet.”
 
	China has responded with offers of concessions. It announced moratoriums on fishing in certain areas, though critics noted that the restrictions apply to seasons when the fish are not as abundant. It vowed to cap the size of its deep-water fleet, though not to reduce it, and to trim the government subsidies it provides fishing companies, many still state-owned or controlled.
 
	In the year that followed the furor over the Galápagos, the bulk of the Chinese fleet kept a greater distance from Ecuador’s exclusive economic zone. Otherwise it continued to fish as much as before.
 
	In Argentina, a group of environmentalists, supported by the Gallifrey Foundation, an ocean conservation organization, filed an injunction with the country’s top court last year in the hope of prodding the government to do more to comply with its constitutional obligations to protect the environment. They plan to submit a similar injunction in the coming months in Ecuador.
 
	“We have a permanent Chinese fleet 200 miles off our coast,” said Pablo Ferrara, a lawyer and professor at the University of Salvador in Buenos Aires, referring to the distance covered by Argentina’s exclusive economic zone.
 
	Argentina’s navy, which sank a Chinese fishing boat inside the zone in 2016, has since announced it would add four new patrol ships to step up its enforcement efforts in its coastal waters.
 
	The United States, too, has pledged to assist smaller nations to counter China’s illegal or unregulated fishing practices. The U.S. Coast Guard, which now calls the practice one of the greatest security threats in the oceans, has dispatched patrol ships to the South Pacific.
 
	In July, President Biden issued a national security memorandum pledging to increase monitoring of the industry. Speaking virtually at a forum of Pacific nations that month, Vice President Kamala Harris said the United States would triple American assistance to help the nations patrol their waters, offering $60 million a year for the next decade.
 
	Such efforts may help in territorial waters, but they do little to restrict China’s fleet on the open seas. The consumption of fish worldwide continues to rise, reaching a record high in 2019. At the same time, the known stocks of most species of fish continue to decline, according to the latest report by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
 
	“The challenge is to persuade China that it, too, has a need to ensure the long-range sustainability of the ocean’s resources,” said Duncan Currie, an international environmental lawyer who advises the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition. “It’s not going to be there forever.”

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Google,Reconstructed Russian Fisheries Catches in the Barents Sea: 1950-2014," 
                                    Citation numbers are available from Dimensions
                                 Wetlands International, Netherlands Independent researcher, Italy Oceanographic Center of Cádiz,Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO), Spain Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece The management of marine living resources that straddle country borders has historically been a challenge, particularly in cases where political tensions are high. The jointly managed fisheries resources in the Barents Sea are a notable exception, wherein the Russian Federation (formerly Soviet Union) and Norway have relatively successfully managed fish stocks together since the 1950s, including during the high tensions of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Using ICES statistics as reported baseline landings, the total catch of the region by the Russian fisheries was reconstructed for the period 1950-2014. Total catch was divided into reported landings, unreported landings, and discards, and assigned to four sectors: industrial, artisanal, recreational, and subsistence. Unreported landings and discards between 1950 and 2014 accounted for ~12 and 55% of the total catch, respectively, with discards being substantial in the early decades. A majority of the catch was caught using pelagic and bottom trawls, contributing to the high rate of discards. Both discards and landings reached their peak in the 1970s, after which overexploitation contributed to numerous stock declines. Stocks recovered in the 1990s following adoption of legislation and gear regulations limiting discards as part of a joint effort by Norway and Russia to more sustainably manage stocks. The trend of declining Russian Barents Sea catches after the 1980s matches global trends of declining catch, although the present case appears to be mainly due to more successful management interventions. It is assumed that small-scale fisheries removals are minor in the region, but further research to refine estimates of small-scale fishing can improve upon the present study. While this study highlights historical declines in catch due to overexploitation, it does not explore fluctuations in catch caused by environmental variation. In the rapidly warming Arctic region it is of vital importance to understand how stocks may be further affected by climate change in addition to fishing pressure. Natural resources are often casualties in human disagreements and political struggles, and resources in the sea are no exception. International cooperation in fisheries is particularly important as fish are not a stationary resource that respect human-made boundaries. In one of the more unique political arrangements in recent history, Norway and the former Soviet Union (now Russian Federation) have created one of the more successful internationally managed fish stock sharing systems in the world, despite high political tensions and the collapse of the Soviet Union (Gullestad et al., 2014; NMFCA, 2018). In a world with increasing international tensions, Norway and Russia's relatively steady efforts at ongoing cooperation on marine resource use in the Barents Sea through the political thicket of the twentieth century show that perhaps some good can happen if both parties are willing to continue dialogue and cooperation, no matter the circumstances. The Barents Sea is a relatively shallow sea nestled in the far north of Europe, between the mainland of Norway and north-west Russia, the islands of the Svalbard archipelago to the west, and the Russian islands of Franz-Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya to the east (here defined as ICES areas Ia and Ib; Figure 1). Co-management of living resources of the Barents Sea first began in 1923 with the negotiation of seal hunting regulations, some of which are still in effect today, while research cooperation between the two countries began even earlier in the l890s (Alexseev et al., 2011). This relationship began to deepen following the establishment of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1902, which both the USSR and Norway were a part of Alexseev et al. (2011). However, Russian participation with ICES ended in 1914 following the outbreak of WWI, and the working relationship between Norway and the USSR deteriorated until the 1950s. It was in 1958 that the region experienced a rebirth in scientific cooperation and knowledge sharing: scientists from the USSR's Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography (PINRO or “ПИHPO”) visited Norway's Institute of Marine Research (IMR, or “Havforskningsinstituttet”) to participate in the first ever Soviet-Norwegian Fishery Conference (Alexseev et al., 2011). The year 1977 brought new challenges with the declaration of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) by both the USSR and Norway. Previously, much of the Barents Sea was high seas water, and thus in principle open for outside countries to exploit. These EEZ declarations left only a small patch of the Barents Sea at the center with the status of high seas waters (ICES area Ia, Figure 1), which effectively left the management of the majority of the Barents Sea in the hands of the two countries. In order to facilitate the declaration of EEZs and subsequent joint management, the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fishery Commission (JNRFC) was established in 1975-76.1 IMR and PINRO continued conducting joint research surveys and symposia as members of the JNRFC to assess the stocks of important commercial fish, such as herring (Clupea harengus), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and cod (Gadus morhua), and provide legal recommendations for quotas and stock management. Norway was therefore one of the first countries to successfully establish economic, scientific, and diplomatic cooperation with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and this strong working relationship has generally continued into today. Figure 1. Map of the Barents Sea region, including the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and shelf areas (to 200 m depth) of the Russian Federation and neighboring Norway. ICES statistical areas fall within the green boundaries. We define the Barents Sea here as corresponding to ICES areas Ia and Ib. The White Sea falls between the Kola peninsula and Arkhangelsk. The Barents Sea and adjacent White Sea (off Arkhangelsk, Figure 1) were among the first areas of the world to develop large-scale commercial fishing. Over 200 fish species are found in the Barents Sea, and ~21 species are commercially targeted by Russian fisheries (Wienerroither et al., 2011). Russian commercial fishing activities in the Barents Sea have existed since the fifteenth century, but were primarily coastal and artisanal in nature, with oar powered vessels and hand lines until the arrival of the first Russian steam trawler in 1906 (Benko and Ponomarenko, 1972; Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011). Prior to the Russian Revolution, trawling pressure came primarily from English and German trawler fleets, which outnumbered Russian trawlers four hundred to one until the 1920s (Shevelev et al., 2011). It was not until WWII that both the Russian trawl fishery and research capacity in fish stocks grew. Two main fleets operated in the Barents region: the Arkhangelsk fleet and the Murmansk fleet (Figure 1). By 1913, the Arkhangelsk fleet had four steam trawlers in operation and by 1920 full-scale development of the Russian trawler fleet was underway. In 1916, the Soviet Union built the city of Murmansk to serve as an industrial and fisheries center and the Murmansk fleet was born (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011; Shevelev et al., 2011). This, along with improvements in technology, e.g., in 1931 the first diesel operated trawler was introduced, resulted in growth of the fishing fleet from 17 industrial fishing vessels in 1927 to 562 trawlers in Murmansk alone by 1955 (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011). From 1950 until 1980, the bottom trawl was the predominant fishing gear in the Russian Barents Sea fishery. Trawling only declined with the decline of Atlantic cod (G. morhua) and haddock (M. aeglefinus) stocks in the 1980s (Matishov et al., 2004) and the weakening of the Soviet economy, which meant cheaper, less fuel-intensive fishing techniques such as longline had to be employed (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011). As a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, much of the Soviet distant-water fleet returned to focus on waters closer to home, including the Barents Sea (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011; Shevelev et al., 2011). However, overall declines in Barents Sea fish stocks meant that despite the increasing fishing effort in the region there was no corresponding increase in catch (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011; Shevelev et al., 2011; Greer, 2014). By 1996, Shevelev et al. (2011) note that “the Russian fishing industry was no longer profitable”; by 2001, fishing effort in the region had peaked and thereafter began declining (Greer, 2014); and by 2005, ~280 trawl vessels worked the North Atlantic, less than half the number that did so in the 1950s (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011; Shevelev et al., 2011). While the overall number of trawl vessels has declined, Russian Barents Sea fisheries are still dominated by bottom and pelagic trawls (Wienerroither et al., 2011; ICES, 2015a). The objective of this study was to reconstruct total Russian fisheries catches (or fisheries removals allocated to Russia during the Soviet Union period) in the Barents Sea region for the period 1950-2014 using the catch reconstruction approach of Zeller et al. (2016), and builds upon and updates a previous preliminary reconstruction of Barents Sea catches by Jovanović et al. (2015). The catch reconstruction approach, first described in Bhathal (2005), develops comprehensive time-series estimates of catches missing from the reported catch baselines (i.e., unreported catches, as well as estimates of discards), and thus provides a more comprehensive picture of total removals from the marine environment. Historical time series data on total fisheries removals are crucial to fisheries management and policy, as they provide a core baseline dataset that can assist in the assessment of the populations upon which fisheries depends (Caddy and Gulland, 1983; Pauly, 2016). Furthermore, they embed any discussions on future fisheries development, management, and policy in the appropriate historical data context. While ICES stock assessment working groups have access to datasets that “outsiders” do not, and do consider some data on discards and unreported catches, these data are rarely made publicly available in sufficient detail due to confidentiality and political reasons, despite these fishes being a public resource (Zeller and Pauly, 2004). As actual total fisheries catches are generally higher than the reported data would suggest (Pauly and Zeller, 2016), we expect that the present study can assist public understanding and policy development for sustainable fisheries decisions by providing a more comprehensive historical baseline of likely total removals of fish from the Barents Sea by Russian fisheries since 1950. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) maintains a publicly accessible database presenting reported landings by country, taxon, ICES statistical area, and year for the period 1950-present2 (ICES, 2017b). This database does not contain data on discards and other unreported catch. There are also some years with gaps in the data, such as the 1950-1954 gap during which the Soviet Union was not a member of ICES, and gap years where catch was likely not reported for certain species despite substantial catch being reported in years previously and subsequently. After slight adjustments to the ICES catch statistics to account for these gaps and disaggregation of Russian catch from the Soviet Union, we refer to these data as “ICES baseline landings” (see Supplementary Material for gap adjustments and USSR disaggregation). As the aim of this study was to determine total catch, six different unreported components of catch were identified, estimated and added to these ICES baseline landings: (1) unreported stock assessment landings (addressing discrepancies between ICES working group catch and ICES reported catch), (2) unreported illegal landings (mainly the result of organized crime and/or poaching), (3) unreported artisanal landings, (4) discards, (5) recreational catch, and (6) subsistence catch. Note that international reporting requests (e.g., FAO) specifically include non-commercial (e.g., recreational) landings, but explicitly exclude discards (Pauly and Zeller, 2016). We consider this anachronistic in an era of ecosystem consideration in fisheries (Pauly and Zeller, 2016). Within the ICES baseline landings data, several years included catch statistics with very coarse taxonomic resolution, i.e., “Finfishes nei,” “Flatfishes nei,” and “Anarhichas” (wolffishes). These broad “nei” (or “not elsewhere included”) categories are often reported to a finer taxonomic resolution in national statistics, suggesting that “nei” categories may be an artifact of the statistical reporting or harmonization process at ICES (Pauly and Zeller, 2015). These uninformative taxonomic groupings were taxonomically disaggregated based on best-available information and conservative assumptions about which species should be included in these categories (Table 1). “Finfishes nei” was disaggregated into the top 10 species caught proportionally by weight, excluding major commercially targetted species (i.e., not cod, capelin, or haddock). Non-major species were chosen under the assumption that they are less likely to be identified to the species or genus level in records, while valuable or commercially important species with dedicated ICES stock assessment groups likely are. “Flatfishes nei” and “Anarhichas” were both disaggregated proportionally by weight of landed flatfish and wolffish species, respectively. Table 1. Taxonomic disaggregation of highly uninformative pooled taxonomic groups (“nei” = not elsewhere included) in the reported catch data for Russia and the former USSR. Russian statistics for the Barents Sea have only been reported as ICES statistical area I, without subarea reference (Figure 1). In order to assign them to more spatially explicit locations, catch was split into each subarea: Ia (High Seas), Ib (Russian EEZ), or Ib (Norwegian EEZ, including Svalbard; Figure 1). Catch was split proportionally by surface area (Table 2). In doing so, most catch was allocated to Russia's EEZ, as that is the largest area, followed by Norwegian waters, followed by High Seas (Ia). As Norway and Russia have numerous bilateral fishing agreements, Russian fishing is indeed occurring in Norwegian waters (Nakken, 1998; FAO, 2007; ICES, 2015a). Very little information could be found on more spatially explicit fishing locations that could be applied to all data, as catch statistics are generally reported in broad geographical regions by national authorities and by ICES. Table 2. Surface areas of individual ICES subareas in the Barents Sea, including EEZ division as derived by the Sea Around Us (Zeller et al., 2016). The Norwegian EEZ includes Svalbard waters. Generally, Russian fishing activities in the Barents Sea can be divided into three main groups by fishing gear: trawl, purse seine, and longline. According to an examination of the cod fishing fleet in the Barents Sea in 2004 (WWF, 2005), ~150 trawlers under 15 m and 200 trawlers over 15 m were active. While nearly half of the fleet is small and could be considered artisanal in nature, we considered all fishing gears that are actively moved through the water or across the seafloor while using engine power as industrial gear (or “large-scale”) irrespective of vessel size, as defined in Martín (2012). Furthermore, given the heavy focus on offshore fishing by relatively large vessels throughout the Barents Sea, we considered the purse seiners and longliners as industrial as well. We therefore considered all landings reported to ICES as part of the industrial sector. Catches by artisanal (i.e., small-scale commercial) fleets were estimated as unreported catches as described below. Six main components of unreported catch were estimated and added to the ICES reported baseline: (1) unreported stock assessment landings from ICES Working group reports, (2) unreported illegal landings (e.g., poaching), (3) unreported artisanal landings, (4) discards, (5) recreational landings, and (6) subsistence landings. The nature of unreported landings differed between the former USSR and the Russian Federation. Official ICES catch statistics are not corrected for unreported catches that may be included in ICES stock assessment working group reports (ICES, 2017a). We considered discrepancies between ICES publicly reported statistics and ICES Working Group reports used for stock assessment as “unreported stock assessment landings.” Unreported landings were added for nine species using data from several ICES Working Group reports (ICES, 2001; 2015a; 2015b; 2015b; 2016). Unreported stock assessment landings added an average of 10% to the total reported landings. Unreported illegal landings, such as obtained through poaching, reflect estimates of entirely unreported landings across the fishery and are criminal in nature. Unreported illegal landings, oftentimes to avoid state control (during the Soviet era) or as a result of organized criminal activity (poaching), occurred throughout nearly the entirety of the study period (O'Hearn, 1980; WWF, 2005; FAO, 2007; Burnett et al., 2008). Historical estimates of tons of underreported catch per ton of reported catch acted as “anchor points” for years where such estimates existed in the literature. In between anchor point years, these estimates of underreporting were linearly interpolated unless otherwise stated. A more in-depth historical context behind these anchor points is presented in the discussion. We assumed unreported illegal landings were zero from 1950 to 1959. This reflects the conservative assumption that all landed catch was reported during the years of Stalin's rule and immediately following his death. From 1960 to 1975, unreported landings (as a percentage of reported landings) rose steadily from 0 to 33%, to reflect an estimate reported in O'Hearn (1980). This 33% rate was kept steady from 1976 until the last year of the Soviet Union (1990) and was increased thereafter to 40%, to reflect an estimate by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries that underreporting had reached a rate of “almost 50 per cent” (Burnett et al., 2008). As the estimate of almost 50% comes from a 2008 report, we assumed 2008 to be the last year of such high underreporting. An underreporting rate of 5% for the year 2014 was chosen given the 2015 Arctic Fisheries Working Group report estimating little to no underreporting (ICES, 2015a); for years between 2008 and 2014, the rate was linearly decreased from 40 to 5%. The above rates of underreporting were applied to the reported baseline landings of all fish except Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). According to the Working Group on North Atlantic salmon (WGNAS), illegal poaching of salmon is a “considerable” problem in the Barents and White Seas, particularly after the 1990s (ICES, 2015b). The report goes on to say that this high level of underreporting continued into the 2000s. Independent estimates of salmon poaching in the region indicate that poaching may reach underreporting levels as high as 50% (Spiridonov and Nikolaeva, 2005). As such, unreported catches for salmon followed the above unreported rates until 1991, at which point underreporting increased to 50% of reported landings and remained at that level until 2014. While all ICES reported landings for Russia were categorized as industrial, Russian national data from the Russian Federation Federal State Statistics Service (фeдepaпьнaя cлyжбaгocyдapcтBeннoй cтaтиcтики) included catch statistics by species for the White Sea separately from the Barents Sea. These data do not seem to be included in the ICES data. Russian national data for only the Barents Sea generally matched ICES statistics very well, and were thus considered to be comparable to the ICES dataset; there was no comparable match between national data and ICES data for the White Sea. Therefore, we assumed ICES baseline statistics did not include catches for the White Sea, and added the national White Sea data as unreported landings. Because the White Sea is a relatively small, sheltered, shallow body of water that is likely being fished by a smaller coastal fleet, we assumed that all landings from within the White Sea were artisanal in nature. Federal statistics were only available for the years 2010-2013, which were averaged and converted into a percentage of reported Barents Sea landings per year (i.e., 0.2%). For all years from 1950 to 2014, we therefore assumed that White Sea artisanal landings were equivalent to 0.2% of reported Russian Barents Sea landings, broken down by taxa as reported in the national data for the White Sea. These landings were designated as unreported artisanal. While artisanal fishing activity has existed in the Barents Sea region since 1950 (Shevelev et al., 2011), our estimate for the whole area is likely not a very comprehensive representation of artisanal fishing in the entire Barents Sea. We consider our approach to provide a very conservative minimal estimate of artisanal activities in these waters, and we would like to encourage further research on non-industrial fishing in the wider Barents Sea area. Discards are unwanted fish (bycatch) that are caught in the process of actively targeting a more desirable species, and are especially common in non-selective fishing gears such as bottom trawls. Bycatch from industrial gears are often discarded overboard and generally experience high mortality rates. While discards happen in nearly all industrial fisheries, there is as of yet no official reporting of Russian discards by fishery within the Barents Sea (ICES, 2015a). Discards were calculated by associating a fishing gear with a primary commercially targeted species, then using independently published estimates of bycatch rates for that gear to calculate the tonnage of discards per tonnage of landed catch. Discards were therefore calculated as a percentage of total landings (reported plus unreported) by major target taxa and gear associated with that target fishery. Only the largest commercial fisheries with the best available information on gear types were chosen to calculate discards; thus, our discard estimates may be underestimating other discards, as discards likely exist for all other fish caught and reported in the Barents Sea. As gear types and discard rates change over the years with improvements in technology and with changes in regulation, the gear type and discard rates associated with each fishery varied by decade. For example, the installation of sorting grids throughout various fisheries meant that discards decreased as time went on. Not only did discards decrease overall as the decades passed, but improvements in trawling technology and better targeting also meant the overall species composition of discards changed. The exception to calculating discards by fishing gear was the crab fishery, where a flat discard rate was applied to all crab and miscellaneous marine invertebrate catches, regardless of how they were caught. While there was insufficient information available to associate the crab fisheries with specific gears, there were multiple independent estimates of rates of bycatch within the crab fishery in general. The Sea Around Us maintains a reconstructed catch database with standardized fishing gears assigned to each fishery wherever possible, and these gears were used for this reconstruction (Cashion et al., 2018). The main fisheries in the Barents can be divided into two categories: pelagic stocks and demersal stocks. Pelagic stocks include capelin (Mallotus villosus), herring (C. harengus), and polar cod (Boreogadus saida), all of which are primarily targeted by pelagic trawl, followed by purse seining. Demersal stocks include cod (G. morhua), haddock (M. aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), redfish (Sebastes spp.), northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), wolffish (Anarhicas spp.), and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) (Benko and Ponomarenko, 1972; Wienerroither et al., 2011; ICES, 2015a). All demersal stocks are primarily targeted by bottom trawl with the exception of the wolffish fishery, a majority of which is caught by longlining. A summary of the gear types used in each fishery and the source of the information is in Table 3. Table 3. Percentage composition of catch by fishing gear types within Russian Barents Sea fisheries. Discard rates varied by fishing gear and decade, to reflect improvements in technology and changes in regulations. Six gear types were chosen and assigned to each fishery: pelagic trawl, purse seine, longline, shrimp trawl, finfish bottom trawl, and flatfish bottom trawl (Table 4). Previously published estimates of global fisheries discards (Alverson et al., 1994; Kelleher, 2005) were used to determine baseline discard rates for each fishery and gear type. Fishery- and location-specific estimates from Alverson et al. (1994) were used for all fisheries pre-1990. After 1990, discard rates were taken from the FAO's updated Kelleher (2005) discards estimates, and applied during years when sorting grids were introduced into various corresponding fisheries as noted in the literature. Sorting grid regulations were introduced for three fisheries during the study period: the northern shrimp trawl (1993), groundfish (including both finfishes and flatfishes) trawl (1997), and Greenland halibut flatfish trawl (2013; Dingsør, 2001; ICES, 2015a); the lower Kelleher (2005) discard rate estimates were therefore introduced in each of those fisheries during those years, respectively (Table 4). Table 4. Discard rates as a percentage of retained catch (landings) by major gear types over time for the Russian Barents Sea fisheries. For years between the older Alverson et al. (1994) rates and newer Kelleher (2005) rates, the discard rates were linearly interpolated. Only the lower, so-called “weighted” discard rates as presented in Alverson et al. (1994) and Kelleher (2005) were used, as they represent a more conservative estimate (Kelleher, 2005). Wherever possible, the gears used in geographic regions closest to the Barents Sea (e.g., “Northeast Atlantic”) or targeting similar species (e.g., “North Sea shrimp trawl”) were used. For a summary of changes in discard rates, see Table 4; for a more detailed description of how discard rates varied through time, see the Supplementary Materials. Discard composition for the entire study period was adapted from IMR/PINRO joint trawling and longlining surveys conducted between 2009 and 2012 (McBride et al., 2014). These surveys were used to develop three “baseline” species compositions that are expected to be caught when trawling or longlining for fish: pelagic trawl species; bottom trawl species; and longline species. The baseline species compositions for pelagic trawls and bottom trawls were then modified over time to reflect the adoption of sorting grids and increased mesh sizes in the trawl fisheries. For more information regarding how discard compositions changed over time, see the Supplementary Materials; for a full timeline outlining discard changes through time, see Table S1. After the experimental introduction of the non-native red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) to the Barents Sea in 1961 in an attempt to start a successful crab fishery (Gjøsæter, 2009), crab fishing has slowly become more popular in the Barents Sea. Because no detailed information on bycatch in the Barents Sea crab fishery has been published, a 6.4% discard rate from a 13 year survey of a similar Bering Sea fishery was used instead (Armstrong et al., 1993). This discard rate was applied to king crabs and to miscellaneous marine invertebrates. Recreational fishing has historically been popular in Russia (FAO, 2007), particularly for salmon on the Kola Peninsula in the Barents Sea region (Figure 1; ICES, 2012, 2015b). The ICES planning group on recreational fishing indicates that on average, recreational fishing accounts for 2–8% of a country's total reported landings (ICES, 2010). However, as there is little to no data on recreational fishing in the Barents Sea region prior to 1990, a likely conservative recreational fishing rate of 0.5% of reported landings was applied for the period 1950-1990. 1990 was likely the year when recreational fishing was first “officially” opened to foreign tourists, and it is assumed that recreational fishing increased in popularity with the increase in tourism to the region after the fall of the Soviet Union. Thus, it was assumed that from 1991 onwards, the lower end estimate of 2% from ICES (2010) was chosen for calculating recreational catch. The exception to the data-poor recreational sector in Russia's Barents Sea waters is recreationally caught Atlantic salmon (S. salar). Recreational catches of salmon after 1991 are exceptionally well documented by the Working Group on North Atlantic salmon (WGNAS; ICES, 2015b). Data on the number of salmon that were caught and then retained each year in the recreational fishery were obtained from the 2015 Working Group report (ICES, 2015b). The average annual mean fork lengths and whole weights of Atlantic salmon, for all sea ages, for each year from 1991 to 2012, were published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and used to convert the number of salmon caught to the weight of salmon caught (Sheehan et al., 2013). For the years 2013 and 2014, the same weight as in 2012 was used. After calculating the total recreational landings per year, the estimated catch of salmon for that year was subtracted from the total. The recreational catch without salmon was then split evenly between seven commonly targeted recreational species described on numerous Russian fishing websites: cod (G. morhua), navaga (Eleginus nawaga), polar cod (B. saida), wolffish (Anarhicas lupus), haddock (M. aeglefinus), saithe (P. virens), and pollack (Pollachius pollachius). While the Soviet Union had public cafeterias to ensure nobody went hungry, food shortages were common and diets were supplemented with home cooking. However, obtaining groceries often involved waiting in long lines and paying exorbitant prices. It is likely that non-commercial catching of fish for family consumption (subsistence) complemented the rural diet, particularly in coastal communities. Catch from subsistence fishing was calculated in two steps: first, the Russian rural population of the Barents Sea was estimated; second, this population estimate was multiplied by per-capita estimates of fish consumption in the USSR and Russia. Per-capita consumption rates were adjusted through time to reflect changes that are noted in the literature. Population data for the period from 1950 to 2001 were obtained from Populstat3, while from 2002-onwards Russian census data for the years 2002 and 2010 were used. For the years between 2002 and 2010, population data were interpolated; for the years 2010 to 2014, estimates of total population size provided by the Federal State Statistics Service4 were used. For both per-capita consumption rates and population, estimates in years between data points were linearly interpolated. See Supplementary Materials for more details. In order to estimate the amount of fish consumed that were actually caught via subsistence fishing (as opposed to being purchased at market), we relied on the conservative estimate derived in the Russian Black Sea fisheries reconstruction (Divovich et al., 2015). Thus, it was assumed that 5% of all fish consumed was caught via subsistence fishing until just after the dissolution of the USSR (1992), thereafter increasing to 20% by 1995 and 26% by 2002 to reflect a decreased reliance on government food services and the increased food costs associated with the collapse of state subsidies (Divovich et al., 2015). The derived per-capita subsistence catch rate was then applied to the estimated rural population around the Barents Sea to estimate a likely total tonnage of subsistence fishing. The species disaggregation for subsistence fish was kept the same as in recreational fishing, as both are small-scale fisheries that employ similar methods of fishing. We recognize that there may be overlaps between recreational and subsistence fishing. Total reconstructed landings (i.e., retained, landed catch that does not include discards) averaged 473,000 t·year−1 during the 1950s and 1960s, peaking at ~1.5 million tons in 1977, and declining to a low point of 92,000 tons in 1990 before rebounding to average annual landings of 457,000 t·year−1 by 2014 (Figure 2A). Landings fluctuated substantially over the time period, with peaks and declines in landings occurring roughly every decade until the mid-2000s, after which landings remained more stable. Officially reported data (accounting for landings only, and excluding discards) under-represented actual total landings for most years, although for the earliest years (1950s) and more recent years (mid-2010s), they seem to account more comprehensively for actual landings (Figure 2A). Figure 2. Reconstructed landings for Russia in the Barents Sea with (A) total reconstructed landings from 1950 to 2014 by sector. Small-scale sectors (artisanal, recreational, subsistence) represent less than 1% of landings. Reported data are overlaid as a line graph. (B) Unreported artisanal, recreational, and subsistence landings, i.e., the “small-scale” component from (A), here expanded for clarity. A relatively small fraction of reconstructed landings was deemed to be small-scale in nature (Figure 2A), these being artisanal, recreational, and subsistence landings (all deemed unreported, Figure 2B). Combined, these three small-scale sectors averaged less than 1% of the total reconstructed landings. Landings in these three sectors remained relatively steady at an average of 1,700 t·year−1 until 1991, which was the year the Russian Federation was declared open to outsiders. At this point, recreational fishing increased dramatically to a total of nearly 12,000 tons in 1992; thereafter, unreported small-scale landings, while varying widely, averaged around 5,600 t·year−1 (Figure 2B). Landings throughout the entire time period were dominated by Atlantic cod (G. morhua) and capelin (M. villosus), which largely drive catch patterns in the Barents (Figure 3A). By the mid-late 1970s, declines in cod stocks resulted in an increased demand for capelin. This demand for capelin rapidly pushed the total fisheries landings higher each year until the 1977 peak. Capelin landings thereafter declined until the first collapse of the stock in 1986-1990, second collapse in 1993-1998, and most recent stock collapse in 2004-2006 (Figure 3A). Haddock (M. aeglefinus), usually caught in fisheries targeting cod, followed similar patterns as the cod catch, while polar cod (B. saida) has its own dedicated smaller pelagic trawl fishery. In all cases, regardless of taxon, landings declined after the late 1970s peak. The “Other” category in Figure 3A consists of an additional 59 individual taxonomic groups, which on average accounted for ~12% of the total landings (Figure 3A). For individual taxon figures, see Supplementary Figure S2. Figure 3. Taxonomic composition of Russian Barents Sea fisheries catches with (A) total landings by the four major landed taxa and all other taxa pooled (n = 59); and (B) total discards by the four major discarded taxa and all other taxa pooled (n = 19). When considering total catches (i.e., including discards) over the 65 years examined here, the total reconstructed catch (77.2 million tons) was approximately three times higher than the total reported catch (25 million tons), a difference of over 52 million tons (Figure 4). While unreported landings were a component of this difference in catch (unreported landings accounted for 12% of total reconstructed catch), the 42.7 million tons of discards by far dominated: discards accounted for 55% of total reconstructed catch. Reported landings, then, accounted for only 33% of reconstructed catch (Table 5). Thus, total Russian catch (including discarded catch) in the Barents Sea increased from an average of 1.2 million t·year−1 in the early 1950s to a peak of 3.8 million tons in 1974, before declining to 330,000 t·year−1 by the mid-2010s (Figure 4). Figure 4. Total reconstructed Russian catch in the Barents Sea, including discards and landings. Reported data (landings only) are overlaid as a black line graph. Fishing effort by the Russian fleet in the Barents Sea from Greer (2014) are overlaid as a secondary black dashed line graph. Note the separate y-axis scales for catch (t·year−1) and effort (kW·day−1). Table 5. Summary of total reconstructed catch for the entire 1950-2014 period, broken down by component. Discards were a substantial component of total Russian catch in the Barents Sea until the wide-scale adoption of sorting grids and bycatch-reduction technology starting in the 1980s (Figure 4). Up until the peak in catches in 1977, discards represented the majority of Russian fisheries catch (greater than 50%). However, after the 1977 peak, discards began to decline. The major driver for this decline was the decrease in discard rates for purse seiners, longliners, and shrimp trawlers (Table 4). The introduction of sorting grids in the shrimp trawl fishery in 1993, followed by grids in the groundfish fisheries in 1997, meant that discards declined to an average of 11% of total catch by the early 2000s (Figure 4). Bottom trawling gear was the source of a majority of discards. Discarded catches were dominated primarily by groundfish taxa, including haddock (M. aeglefinus), redfish (Sebastes spp.), and cod (G. morhua, Figure 3B). All three species are prominent bycatch species in the cod bottom trawl fishery. The widely distributed Greenland halibut (R. hippoglossoides) is the fourth most discarded species. At least an additional 19 other taxonomic groups (comprising the “Other” category) contribute to discarding, making up ~11% of total discards (Figure 3B). For individual taxon figures, see Supplementary Figure S3. The Barents Sea has historically been a rich fishing ground, with both Russia and Norway taking advantage of the natural abundance of the region. In the second half of the twentieth century, however, Russian fisheries in the Barents Sea have declined since a historical peak in the late 1970s, which is consistent with other findings indicating that global catch has peaked in the last decades of the twentieth century and is now declining (Pauly and Zeller, 2016). Historical patterns of Russian landings from the Barents Sea are notably quite similar to independently reconstructed Norwegian landings in the region (Figure 5; Nedreaas et al., 2015). Given the long history of co-management of Barents Sea resources and the 50–50 quota split agreed upon by the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission, this is not entirely unexpected (Holm and Nielsen, 2007). However, it is also indicative that overall declines in Barents Sea stock abundances are affecting both Russian and Norwegian fisheries equally (Matishov et al., 2004), and addressing any fisheries declines in the region must be tackled just as equally (NMFCA, 2018). In the past, the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fishery Commission has done this successfully (Alexseev et al., 2011; Gullestad et al., 2014), and reconstructed catch notably improved after the 1980s decline for both Russian and Norwegian fisheries. Figure 5. Total reconstructed landings in the Barents Sea (ICES areas Ia and Ib only) by Norwegian (Nedreaas et al., 2015) and Russian fisheries. The planned nature of the former Soviet economy was designed to allocate goods and services as effectively as possible across all sectors of Russian society. During the Stalin years in the first half of the 1950s, harsh authoritarian rule likely prevented the underground economy from thriving. After Stalin's death, however, widespread corruption and a weak economy led to the steady rise of the Soviet “second” or “shadow” economy—i.e., the black market. The black market was so important to maintaining Russians' access to goods and services that unregulated and illegal economic activities were pervasive in all sectors of the economy. Nearly a third of all food purchased for the home was done so via this black market (Sampson, 1987), and nearly a quarter of the fish produced entered this black market (O'Hearn, 1980). Soviet fisheries were not immune to this pervasive corruption. Illegal underreporting of catch began to steadily rise following Stalin's death in 1953 and the subsequent loosening of authoritarian control. The government, however, was not ignorant of underreporting; in fact, as one Soviet official noted, “the government knows exactly who is dealing in what—arrests are only made when there is some larger political reason,” and data on fish and game in particular was “very good” (O'Hearn, 1980). In reports O'Hearn found in the Soviet press from the 1980s, Soviet observers lamenting the lack of environmental oversight commented on the “painfully large number” of poachers using the black market for personal gain. Small fines for poaching, along with the opportunity to fetch up to 4 to 10 times the “official” Soviet price, meant that poaching was commonplace throughout Soviet fisheries (O'Hearn, 1980). It was standard practice for fishers to first offer catch on the black market and then officially hand in the rest, and it was estimated that by the 1980s, roughly 25% of total commercial catch was meant for the black market. Official Soviet reports note that unreported landings may have been as high as 267% of reported catch (O'Hearn, 1980). To remain conservative, the lower estimate of 25% of total catch, or one third of reported catch, was chosen in the present study for calculating unreported commercial catch during this time period. It is possible that our study therefore underestimated actual catches during the Soviet period. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, underreporting of catch only increased further in all of the former Soviet republics. Rates of illegal fishing increased as a result of the sudden collapse of Soviet regulations and controls and the opening of the market to the outside world as the iron curtain lifted (FAO, 2007). It is during this period from the late 1990s to the early 2000s that the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries began apprehending Russian fishing vessels in the Barents Sea in order to enforce bilateral quotas and reported their conservative estimate of overfishing “of almost 50 per cent” by Russian ships in the Barents Sea (Burnett et al., 2008). More recently, reports of illegal catch and underreporting have substantially decreased. This is mostly a result of greater cooperation and enforcement on the part of the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission. In fact, one of the most recent Arctic Fisheries Working Group reports estimates that there has been little to no illegal or unreported commercial catch in recent years (ICES, 2015a). In the case of cod in particular, reports from Norwegian-Russian analysis groups indicate that actual catches of cod have roughly matched officially reported landings of cod since 2009 (ICES, 2015a). Our conservative estimates of unreported black-market landings during the Soviet era and immediately post-Soviet collapse has interesting implications for discards. Because discards are calculated as a proportion of both reported and unreported landed catch, calculated discards would have more than doubled for the time period if a higher rate of landings underreporting would have been applied, without any change in fishing effort. The subsequent collapse of certain fisheries (such as cod and capelin) could then potentially be attributed not only to the high rate of discarding in Soviet fisheries, but to a high rate of unreported catch as well. Future adjustments and improvements upon this catch reconstruction should aim to refine this estimate of underreporting in Soviet fisheries. The Barents Sea has experienced considerable fluctuations in both stock abundances and catch that has been documented by the Norwegians as early as 1860, if not earlier (Alexseev et al., 2011). In particular, the capelin stock has been known to be highly variable (Gjøsæter, 2009). Indeed, these large natural variations in capelin are one of the primary reasons fisheries scientists first came to research the Barents Sea (Alexseev et al., 2011). Similar fluctuations in cod, haddock, and saithe catches in the White Sea have been documented as well (Alexseev et al., 2011). Typically, these fluctuations are the result of abiotic factors unique to the biogeography of the region, such as the nutrient load of the system after winter (Matishov et al., 2004). These historical trends appear to have continued into the present day given the fluctuations in capelin and cod catch (Figure 3A). Reported landings of cod in the earlier period of this study (1950-1980) before the stock collapse exhibit regular periodicity, which in turn drive the periodicity behind the majority of unreported landings and discards (Figures 3A,B). This periodicity has been well documented in the literature, where it has been found that the Barents Sea cod stock fluctuates in harmony with the Kola temperature cycle (Nakken, 1994; Yndestad, 2003; Ottersen et al., 2014). However, the regular rise and fall of reported catch appears to be unusual and does not closely match any cyclical trends of Norwegian cod catch in the region (Figure 6), and could potentially be driven by misreporting to ICES by the former Soviet Union. It remains to be determined if the substantial redirection of (unmonitored) catches to the black market may be a contributing factor to the unusually large fluctuations seen in USSR-reported data on cod catches in the first 3 decades of the present time series (Supplementary Figure S1). Figure 6. Reported landings of cod (Gadus morhua) by both Norway and Russia in the Barents Sea. Norwegian reported landings of Barents Sea cod do not exhibit fluctuations in landings to the same degree that Russian reported landings of cod do. Russian fisheries in the Barents are heavily dominated by bottom and pelagic trawling. Trawling had already been established by the 1920s but became especially well developed by the 1950s (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011; Shevelev et al., 2011) and only intensified through the 1960s-1970s. Initially, trawls primarily targeted cod and other demersal fish stocks, while capelin and herring were only caught as baitfish. As trawling intensified, however, these conventional stocks declined and both Norway and the Soviet Union began to develop purse seine and pelagic trawl fisheries for the industrial targeting of capelin in the Barents Sea (Gjøsæter, 2009). Both pelagic and bottom trawling continued to dominate Russian fisheries, while Norwegians steadily developed longline fisheries at an industrial scale (Gjøsæter, 2009). The first Russian automated longliner, borrowed from well-established Norwegian technology, was only introduced into the Russian fishery in 1982 (Gjøsæter, 2009). By the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union, with the associated collapse of the subsidies system and resulting economic downturn, meant that there was a reduction of trawling effort. Trawlers required more fuel and active fishing time, and were thus more expensive to operate. This led to an overall reduction in catch along with marginal increases in the number of longliners in the Russian Barents Sea fishery (Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011). However, even to the present day, trawlers still dominate the Russian fleet, accounting for around 90% of total Russian catch in the Barents Sea (Nakken, 1998; Grekov and Pavlenko, 2011; Wienerroither et al., 2011; ICES, 2015a). Recent declines in catch beginning in the 1970s are strongly tied to overexploitation (Matishov et al., 2004; Pavlovich, 2016). Given that Norwegian and Russian researchers and government bodies alike acknowledge overexploitation and discarding of underage fish in the 1970s-1980s as a primary cause for the decline of both pelagic and demersal stocks, including cod (Nakken, 1994; Gullestad et al., 2014), haddock (Kiseleva and Nichols, 2016), redfish (McBride et al., 2014) herring (Gjøsæter, 1995), and capelin (Beverton, 1990; Hjermann et al., 2004), it is not unreasonable to assume other stocks were affected by the excessive fishing effort in the region as well (Figure 4). Modern trawling technology is notorious for scooping up entire schools of fish, with midwater and bottom trawl fleets equipped with immense nets that can reach over 100 m in width and several hundred meters in length (Morgan and Chuenpagdee, 2003) and electronics such as echosounders, gyro-compasses, and radio direction finders (introduced into the Barents Sea fishing fleets in the 1950s; Shevelev et al., 2011), all designed to catch as many tons of fish as possible in one trip. Unless considerably larger mesh sizes are introduced, nets capture all age-classes of a stock, preventing any stock recovery let alone growth in the coming years, as happened with the Barents Sea herring and capelin stocks (Beverton, 1990; Alexseev et al., 2011; Shevelev et al., 2011). Bottom trawling, in particular, is known to be highly destructive, decimating slow-growing deep-water stocks of fish and damaging the benthic habitat structures that they may depend on (Løkkeborg and Fosså, 2011; Norse et al., 2012; Puig et al., 2012). The high rates of both pelagic and bottom trawling in combination with high rates of discarding as compared to the Norwegian fleet (Nedreaas et al., 2015) may therefore have contributed to the rapid declines of stocks in the Barents Sea in the 1970s-1980s. While unreported fishing is occurring in both countries, it does not appear to substantially differentiate the total amount of catch landed between the two countries (Nedreaas et al., 2015). The largest discrepancy in total catch between the two countries is instead primarily due to the high amount of discarding within the Russian fishery, as Russian fisheries primarily employ trawlers (rather than longliners; Nakken, 1998; Wienerroither et al., 2011; McBride et al., 2014). Bottom trawlers are especially well-known for being the most non-selective fishing gear, and our study is consistent with global findings that discarding is dominated by bottom trawling gear (Cashion et al., 2018). Barents Sea discards seem primarily composed of haddock, redfish, and cod that were most likely discarded as a result of being underage or undersized (Spiridonov and Nikolaeva, 2005; Gullestad et al., 2014; ICES, 2015c). Nakken (1994) notes that in the 1980s, discards of cod only increased due to the poor condition of the fish—many of which were too small—which only exacerbated the corrosive cycle of discarding. Reconstructed discards indicate that after the widespread adoption of larger mesh sizes and sorting grids in the 1990s, discards declined considerably, which likely played an important role in the subsequent recovery of capelin, cod, and redfish stocks in the 1990s and 2000s. Redfish species have historically been particularly hard-hit by discarding practices, with golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) listed on the Norwegian endangered species list in 2010 and beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) only recently showing signs of stock recovery as a result of improvements to trawling gear in the northern shrimp fishery (Wienerroither et al., 2011; McBride et al., 2014). The discrepancy in discarding between the two countries may further be driven by the fact that discarding dead or dying cod and haddock has been illegal in Norway since 1987, while discarding has been banned (with some exemptions) for all fishes since 2009 (Gullestad et al., 2014; Ottemo, 2017; NMFCA, 2018). On the other hand, this may also explain why Norway's landed catch in the region is higher than Russia's: Norway simply may not be discarding as much of their catch (Figure 5). It has been noted that while discarding has been substantially reduced in the Russian waters of the Barents Sea, it is still a problem (Spiridonov and Nikolaeva, 2005; Burnett et al., 2008). While the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries says that Russia has “discard regulations” in place for the Barents Sea cod, it is not clear that there is any explicit anti-discarding action in Russia aside from sorting grids (Gullestad et al., 2014). The European Union introduced the concept of a blanket ban on discarding in 20155, including in Russian waters within the Baltic (Bekyashev, 2017). Given the discard bans of its neighbors, including within its own waters, these regulations may have future implications in Russian Barents waters: a well-enforced discard ban by the Russian government would clearly benefit not only the shared fish stocks within Russian waters, but also Russian fleets. Small-scale fisheries are notoriously data deficient (Pauly and Charles, 2015; Zeller et al., 2015; Pauly and Zeller, 2016), and those of the Barents Sea are no exception. Numerous assumptions were made in our study while estimating artisanal, recreational, and subsistence fishing. While we are confident that our estimates are conservative and not overestimates, future research should further refine reconstructed small-scale fisheries removals. The Barents Sea ecosystem today faces additional threats, being in the rapidly warming Arctic region (Johannessen et al., 2004; Drinkwater et al., 2011; Stige and Kvile, 2017). While catch has certainly declined in part due to the intense historical fishing pressure in the region, there are likely other factors at play, and it is uncertain exactly to what degree fluctuations in catch are the result of variable or unsustainably high fishing mortality or from other abiotic or climatic factors. There is evidence that species composition in the Barents Sea is shifting as communities move farther north with the warming waters (Kortsch et al., 2012; Frainer et al., 2017). In addition, the Barents Sea is not unaffected by the scourge of introduced species invasions, including the deliberate introduction of red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus), which can result in changes in food web, trophic, and community structure (Pedersen et al., 2018). As such, both climate change and introduced species may be contributing to changes in catch and catch composition that this study could not address. The rise of industrial trawling in the Russian Barents Sea fisheries during the second half of the twentieth century came at an unfortunate price: a monumental five-fold increase in discards between 1950 and the mid-1970s. This, combined with steadily rising fishing effort in the region during the first five decades, resulted in numerous stock collapses and associated declines in catches. The subsequent poor state of the cod stock in the 1980s spurred one of the more successful jointly managed straddling fish stock management systems in recent history, and played a key role in the decline in discards by the 1980s. While reducing discards plays an important role in stock recovery (Matishov et al., 2004; Zeller et al., 2018), it is only with the cooperation of all parties involved and precautionary, long-term sustainable management that the recovery of the shared Barents Sea resources is possible (Misund et al., 2011). Preservation of the cod stock in the Barents Sea was the primary impetus behind this steady and impressive cooperative effort, with both Russia and Norway—two countries with major cultural and political differences—in agreement on closing fishing areas and reducing discards as a fisheries management strategy for cod recovery (Gullestad et al., 2014; Ottemo, 2017). It is in this sense that the cooperative effort to rebuild and manage stocks between both Russia and Norway is remarkable. SP reconstructed the catch, and SP and DZ prepared the manuscript.

                    Historical reconstructions of marine fisheries catches: challenges and opportunities
                ",2018-07-16
Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Google,‘Phenomenal loophole’ in quotas could lead to massive overfishing," Exclusive: Drastically weakened rules on how vessels document their catches of endangered species could endanger the marine ecosystem, confidential EU papers reveal A push by EU fishing nations including France and Spain to weaken how fish catches are reported could see massive overfishing of endangered species and even “call into question” the whole point of setting quotas, according to confidential EU documents seen by the Guardian. Europe’s most commonly fished species – which include mackerel, tuna, Atlantic herring and sprat – could be threatened under the latest proposal, which would apply to all vessels in EU waters. At issue is how fish catches are logged to ensure that vessels are not overfishing. Bloc rules currently allow a 10% margin of tolerance between the declared catch for each fish species in a vessel’s logbook and the quantity they report after landing. But fishing nations want to expand a loophole applied to the Baltic in 2016 that widens the scope of the 10% margin to vessels’ total catches. Such a “phenomenal loophole” removes any penalty for vessels that submit completely inaccurate estimates for vulnerable fish species, according to one of the European Commission papers. The loophole has “incentivised hidden overfishing and even calls into question the usefulness of fishing conservation measures, such as quota setting, in a scenario where such quotas can be easily circumvented without any consequence”, the paper said. The papers, circulated to diplomats and parliamentary negotiators in February, added: “This derogation has led to huge misreporting, in particular underreporting and overfishing of quota species. Misreporting of catches is the precursor to unsustainable fishing, which over time risks resulting in depletion of fish stocks and ultimately to disruption of the marine ecosystem.” Preliminary EU audits found that misreporting in the Baltic last year was “incentivised” by the derogation and was accompanied by overfishing, another document says. Sprat, for example, is a species protected by a quota, but in samples from one EU state, sprat was underreported by 78%, while hauls of non-quota species were overreported by 819%, according to the audit, which is mentioned in the EU papers. The average underreporting of herring and sprat in another state were 36% and 63% respectively. Conservationists fear that such underreporting could have permanent repercussions on the vulnerable fish. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) committee, which gives the EU scientific advice on catch limits, has called for precautionary quotas to protect sprat populations in the Baltic. Massimiliano Cardinale, an adviser to ICES, said that applying the margin of tolerance to total catches put populations of smaller fish in jeopardy. “If you fish two stocks that have a very different biomass with a 10% total catch tolerance, you will have a much larger risk of overfishing the smaller population,” he said. “That’s just an obvious consequence.” Fish stocks most threatened by weakened reporting protocols include yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean, which thinktanks and marine scientists have warned could collapse by 2026 if overfishing continues. EU fishing boats scoop up around a third of the ocean’s tuna catch. They use a method called purse seine that uses nets about 2km long and 200m deep, which also trapnon-target species such as sea turtles, sharks and rays, according to the Global Tuna Alliance, an independent tuna industry association. They also trap mainly juvenile tuna, which make up 63-71% of the EU fleet’s yellowfin tuna catch using this purse seining method, depending on the time of year, according to October 2022 data from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Against this backdrop, entrenching the 10% reporting loophole would “legalise misreporting, in particular underreporting of several if not all quota species, erasing almost 40 years of improved accuracy of catch reporting in the EU, by bringing EU fishing standards back to 1983,” the first commission document says. It would also “go against” targets in the Cop15 agreement on nature protection. The quarrel is part of an internal EU haggle over modernising fisheries controls, which were proposed by Brussels in 2018 but challenged ever since by fishing nations such as France, Denmark and Spain. The EU’s environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, has compromised on plans to fit CCTV onboard all vessels, but made the loophole a red line. He has reportedly threatened to withdraw the entire legislative package in negotiations on Wednesday, according to two officials. Sinkevičius declined to comment. Europêche, the fishing industry trade group, argued that it is too difficult to apply the new rules to fleets fishing for species such as tropical tuna, and that the suspension of fishing licences and “immobilisation” of vessels after they have amassed too many penalty points is unfair. Defending the proposals, Daniel Voces, the managing director of Europêche, said: “The current provisions relating to the margin of tolerance are penalising our shipowners and skippers, particularly the tuna industry, who are facing extreme sanctions, the allocation of points and even risking losing their jobs due to the impossibility to comply with a rule that is unworkable for the industry in its current form. “If the problem is not fixed soon, I’m afraid the EU tuna purse seine fleet will disappear in a matter of years.” The marine conservation group Oceana disputed the scale of the cost posed to industry by the new rules. “Only a handful of serial offenders risk becoming unprofitable,” said Vanya Vulperhorst, Oceana’s campaign director. Giving in to them would be “a complete contradiction of the EU’s zero-tolerance policy to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, [and] put further at risk already overfished stocks such as yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean”.",2023-03-16

 98k Accesses 777 Citations 1375 Altmetric Metrics details Fisheries data assembled by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) suggest that global marine fisheries catches increased to 86 million tonnes in 1996, then slightly declined. Here, using a decade-long multinational ‘catch reconstruction’ project covering the Exclusive Economic Zones of the world’s maritime countries and the High Seas from 1950 to 2010, and accounting for all fisheries, we identify catch trajectories differing considerably from the national data submitted to the FAO. We suggest that catch actually peaked at 130 million tonnes, and has been declining much more strongly since. This decline in reconstructed catches reflects declines in industrial catches and to a smaller extent declining discards, despite industrial fishing having expanded from industrialized countries to the waters of developing countries. The differing trajectories documented here suggest a need for improved monitoring of all fisheries, including often neglected small-scale fisheries, and illegal and other problematic fisheries, as well as discarded bycatch. Marine fisheries are the chief contributors of wholesome seafood (finfish and marine invertebrates; here ‘fish’). In many developing countries (and likely also in many ‘transition‘ countries), fish is the major animal protein source that rural people can access or afford1; and they are also an important source of micronutrients essential to people with otherwise deficient nutrition2. However, the growing popularity of fish in countries with developed or rapidly developing economies creates a demand that cannot be met by fish stocks in their own waters (for example, the EU, the USA, China and Japan). These markets are increasingly supplied by fish imported from developing countries, or caught in the waters of developing countries by various distant-water fleets3,4,5, with the consequences that:  Foreign and/or export-oriented domestic industrial fleets are increasingly fishing in the waters of developing countries5,6, Industrially caught fish has become a globalized commodity that is mostly traded between continents rather than consumed in the countries where it was caught7, and The small-scale fisheries that traditionally supplied seafood to coastal rural communities and the interior of developing countries (notably in Africa)8 are forced to compete with the export-oriented industrial fleets without much support from their governments. The lack of attention that small-scale fisheries suffer in most parts of the world9 manifests itself in potentially misleading statistics that are submitted annually by many member countries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which may omit or substantially underreport small-scale fisheries data10. FAO harmonizes the data submitted by its members, which then becomes the only global data set of fisheries statistics in the world, widely used by policy makers and scholars11. This data set, however, may not only underestimate artisanal (that is, small scale, commercial) and subsistence fisheries10, but also generally omit the catch of recreational fisheries, discarded bycatch12 and illegal and otherwise unreported catch, even when some estimates are available13. Thus, except for a few obvious cases of over-reporting14, the landings data updated and disseminated annually by the FAO on behalf of member countries may considerably underestimate actual fisheries catch. While this underestimation is widely known among many fisheries scientists working with FAO catch data, and is freely acknowledged by FAO, its global magnitude has not been explicitly presented until now. Here we present the results of an approach called ‘catch reconstruction’15,16 that utilizes a wide variety of data and information sources to derive estimates for all fisheries components missing from the official reported data. We find that reconstructed global catches between 1950 and 2010 were 50% higher than data reported to FAO suggest, and are declining more strongly since catches peaked in the 1990s. These findings and the country-specific technical work underlying these results will hopefully contribute to member countries submitting more accurate fisheries statistics to FAO. Such improved and more comprehensive data contribute a foundation that can facilitate the implementation of ecosystem-based fisheries management17, which is a component of the ‘FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries’18. The sum of the reconstructed catches of all sectors in all Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of the world, plus the catch of tuna and other large pelagic fishes in the High Seas leads to two major observations (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1). First, the trajectory of reconstructed catches differs substantially from those reported by FAO on behalf of its member countries. The FAO statistics suggest that, starting in 1950, the world catch (actually ‘landings’, as discarded catches are explicitly excluded from the global FAO data set) increased fairly steadily to 86 million tonnes (mt) in 1996, stagnated and then slowly declined to around 77 mt by 2010 (Fig. 1). In contrast, the reconstructed catch peaked at 130 mt in 1996 and declined more strongly since. Thus, the reconstructed catches are overall 53% higher than the reported data. Contrast between the world’s marine fisheries catches, assembled by FAO from voluntary submissions of its member countries (‘reported’) and that of the catch ‘reconstructed’ to include all fisheries known to exist, in all countries and in the High Sea (‘reconstructed’=‘reported’+estimates of ‘unreported’). The mean weighted percentage uncertainty of the reconstructed total catches (over all countries and fisheries sectors) based on the quality scores attributed to each sector in each country and territory (dashed line) is also shown. Furthermore, since the year of peak catches in 1996, the reconstructed catch declined strongly at a mean rate of −1.22 mt·per year, whereas FAO, at least until 2010, described the reported catch cautiously as characterized by ‘stability’19,20, though it exhibited a gradual decline (−0.38 mt·per year). The reconstructed total catches therefore represent a decline of over three times that of the reported data as presented by FAO on behalf of countries. A segmented regression21 identifies two breakpoints in the catch time series (that is, change in trend) of the reconstructed total catches as well as the reported catches. These are in 1967 as a result of a changing slope of the catch time series from a stronger increase prior to 1967 (reconstructed catches=2.82 mt·per year; reported catches=1.88 mt·per year) to a slower increase after 1967 (reconstructed catches=1.86 mt·per year; reported catches=1.30 mt·per year). The second breakpoint is in 1996 (the year of peak catch), with a subsequently decreasing trend (that is, slope) of −1.22 mt·per year for reconstructed catches and −0.38 mt per·year for reported catches, as also presented for the simple regression above (Fig. 1; see also Supplementary Table 2). Note that the recent, stronger decline in reconstructed total catches is not due to some countries reducing catch quotas so that stocks can rebuild. For example, a similar decline (−1.01 mt·per year) in reconstructed catches is obtained when the catch from the Unites States, Northwestern Europe, Australia and New Zealand (that is, countries where quota management predominates) is excluded (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table 3). Effects of removing discards on estimates of seafood caught per capita, and of removing the catches of the major countries using quota management (that is, USA, New Zealand, Australia and Western Europe) on reconstructed total catches. Closer examination of the reconstructed versus reported catches in each of the 19 maritime FAO statistical areas suggests that some of the areas where industrial fishing originated, such as the Northwest Atlantic (FAO area 21), are the first regions of the world to demonstrate declining catches (Fig. 3). In contrast, lower-latitude areas demonstrate declines later, or still appear to have increasing catches, for example, the Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans still showing generally increasing trends in reported catches (Fig. 3). Contrasting reconstructed and reported catches in the 19 maritime ‘Statistical Areas’ which FAO uses to roughly spatialize the world catch. Note that for Area 18 (Arctic), the reported catch by the U.S. and Canada was zero, while only Russia (former-USSR) reported a small catch in the late 1960s, even though the coastal fishes of the high Arctic are exploited by Inuit and others. We present, for the first time, global reconstructed marine fisheries catches by fisheries sectors (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 4). They are dominated by industrial fisheries, which contribute 73 mt of landings in 2010, down from 87 mt in 2000 (Fig. 4). At the global scale it is a declining industrial catch (combined with the smaller contribution of gradually reduced levels of discarding)12 that leads to declining global catches since 1996, while the artisanal sector, which generates a catch increasing from about 8 mt·per year in the early 1950s to 22 mt·per year in 2010, continues to show gradual growth in catches at the global scale (Fig. 4). Reconstructed catches for all countries in the world, plus High Seas, by large-scale (industrial) and small-scale sectors (artisanal, subsistence, recreational), with discards (overwhelmingly from industrial fisheries) presented separately. Also noticeable is that the inter-annual variations (small peaks and troughs) in both reconstructed catches and reported catches (Fig. 1) are mainly driven by industrial data, which are relatively well documented and reported in time series, while the small-scale sector data are smoother over time (Fig. 4), and more strongly influenced by continuity assumptions over time as part of the national reconstructions. While some countries increasingly include subsets of artisanal catches in official catch statistics provided to FAO, subsistence fisheries catches (Fig. 4) rarely are10. Worldwide, subsistence fisheries caught an estimated 3.8 mt·per year between 2000 and 2010 (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 4). The current global estimate of just under 1 mt·per year of recreational catches is rather imprecise, and recreational fishing is declining in developed, but increasing in developing countries. Discarded bycatch, generated mainly by industrial fishing, notably shrimp trawling22, was estimated at 27 mt·per year (±10 mt) and 7 mt·per year (±0.7 mt) in global studies conducted for FAO in the early 1990s and 2000s, respectively23,24. However, these point estimates were not incorporated into FAO’s global ‘capture’ database, which thus consists only of landings. Here, these studies are used, along with numerous other sources, to generate time series of discards (Fig. 4). Discards, after peaking in the late 1980s, have declined, and during 2000–2010, an average of 10.3 mt·per year of fish were discarded. Our reconstructed catch data, which combines the data reported to FAO with estimates of unreported catches (that is, reconstructed data are ‘reported FAO data+unreported catches’) include estimates of uncertainty (Fig. 1) associated with each national reconstruction. Note that many reconstructions are associated with high uncertainty, especially for earlier decades, for sectors such as subsistence which receive less data collection attention by governments, and for small countries or territories (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 5)10. We include uncertainty estimates here, despite the fact that reconstructions address an inherent negative bias in global catch data (that is, address the ‘accuracy’ of data) and not the replicability of catch data collection (that is, the statistical ‘precision’ of such estimates), which is what ‘uncertainty’ estimates (for example, confidence limits) generally are used for. We do recognize that any estimates of unreported catches implies a certain degree of uncertainty, but so do officially reported data. Most countries in the world use sampling schemes, estimations and raising factors to derive their national catch data they officially report domestically and internationally, all without including estimates of the uncertainty inherent in the numbers being reported as official national catches. Our comparison of the reconstructed versus reported catches in each of the 19 maritime FAO statistical areas suggests that some of the lower-latitude areas still appear to have increasing reported catches. This generally increasing trend is most pronounced in the Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans (Fig. 3), where the reconstructed catches are most uncertain, as the statistics of various countries could only partially correct a regional tendency to exaggerate reported catches5. FAO’s Indian and Western Central Pacific Oceans areas are also the only ones with an increasing FAO reported catch, which, when added to that of other FAO areas, makes the FAO reported world catch appear more stable than it is based on our global reconstructions. Our data and analyses show that, at the global scale, it is a declining industrial catch (plus a smaller contribution of gradually declining discards)12 that provide for the declining global catches, while artisanal fishing continues to show slight growth in catches (Fig. 4). Thus, the gradually increasing incorporation of artisanal and other small-scale catches in the officially reported data presented by FAO on behalf of countries is partly masking the decline in industrial catches at the global level. Since officially reported data are not (at the international level) separated into large-scale versus small-scale sectors25, this trend could not be easily documented until now. Obviously, these patterns may vary between countries. Furthermore, while parts of artisanal catches are increasingly included in official catch statistics by some countries, non-commercial subsistence fisheries catches, a substantial fraction of it through gleaning by women in coastal ecosystems such as coral reef flats and estuaries26 are generally neglected. The importance of subsistence fishing for the food security of developing countries, particularly in the tropical Indo-Pacific, cannot be overemphasized10,27. Our preliminary and somewhat imprecise reconstruction of recreational catches indicates that this sector is largely missing from official reported data, despite FAO’s annual data requests explicitly allowing inclusion of recreational catch data. This activity, however, generates an estimated 40 billion USD·per year of global benefits, involves between 55 and 60 million persons, and generates about one million jobs worldwide28. Finally, our country-by-country reconstructed data supports previous studies illustrating that global discards have decreased12,24. Discarded catches should therefore be included in catch databases, if only to allow for correct inferences on the state of the fisheries involved in this problematic practice. The reconstructed catch data presented here for the first time for all countries in the world can contribute to formulating better policies for governing the world’s marine fisheries, with a first step being the recognition in national policies of the likely magnitude of fisheries not properly captured in the official national data collection systems. This recognition will hopefully contribute to improvements in national data collection systems, an aspiration that we share with FAO. For example, in Mauritania and Guinea Bissau, which, in large part as a result of the reconstructions29,30 and our ongoing direct engagement with these countries, are now initiating national data collection systems for recreational fisheries (a growth industry in both countries and missing from current data systems). It is hoped that this type of data, and other missing data (for example, subsistence catches)10, will be included in future national data reports to FAO, as is the case for some other countries such as Finland31. The taxonomic composition of this reconstructed catch (not presented here but available from the Sea Around Us and through the individual catch reconstruction reports, see Supplementary Table 5) can also contribute to the development of more useful first-order indicators of fisheries status32,33,34 than has been possible previously, especially in the absence of comprehensive stock assessments for all taxa targeted. A policy change that would be straightforward for FAO to coordinate and implement with all countries around the world is to request countries to submit their annual catch statistics separately for large-scale and small-scale fisheries25, which would be an excellent contribution towards the implementation of the ‘Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-scale Fisheries in the Context of Food Security and Poverty Eradication’ recently adopted and endorsed at the thirty-first Session of the FAO Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture (COFI) in June 2014 (ref. 35). While we have found that many countries already have such data or data structure at hand, until all countries can implement such a data-change request, FAO could incorporate such a split into their internal data harmonization procedures, based, for example, on the same or similar information sources as used by the reconstructions. The very high catches that were achieved globally in the 1990s were probably not sustainable. However, they do suggest that stock rebuilding, as successfully achieved in many Australian and US fisheries, and beginning to be applied in some European fisheries, is a policy that needs wider implementation, and which would generate even higher sustained benefits than previously estimated from reported catches36. On the other hand, the recent catch decline documented here is of considerable concern in its implication for food security, as evidenced by the decline in per capita seafood availability (Fig. 2). Note that the recent, strong decline in reconstructed total catches is also evident if catches in countries with well-established quota management systems (United States, Northwestern Europe, Australia and New Zealand) are excluded (Fig. 2). Low quotas are generally not imposed when a stock is abundant; rather low and reduced quotas in fully developed fisheries are generally a management intervention to reduce fishing pressure as a result of past overfishing. Similarly, it has been proposed that strongly declining catches in unmanaged, heavily exploited fisheries are likely a sign of overfishing32,33,34. The often raised suggestion that aquaculture production can replace or compensate for the shortfall in wild capture seafood availability, while being questionable for various reasons37, is not addressed here. The last policy relevant point to be made here transcends fisheries in that it deals with the accuracy of the data used by the international community for its decision making, and the generation of factual knowledge that this requires. After the creation of the United Nations and its technical organizations, including the FAO, a major project of ‘quantifying the world’38 began to provide data for national and international agencies on which they could base their policies. As a result, large databases, for example on agricultural crops and forest cover, were created whose accuracy is becoming increasingly important given the expanding exploitation of our natural ecosystems39. Periodic validation of these databases should therefore be a priority to ensure they avoid producing ‘poor numbers’40. For example, reports of member countries to FAO about their forest cover, when aggregated at the global level, suggest that the annual rate of forest loss between 1990/2000 and 2001/2005 was nearly halved, while the actual loss rate doubled when assessed by remote sensing and rigorous sampling41. Similarly, here we show that the main trend of the world marine fisheries catches is not one of ‘stability’ as cautiously suggested earlier by FAO42, but one of decline. Moreover, this decline, which began in the mid-1990s, started from a considerably higher peak catch than suggested by the aggregate statistics supplied by FAO members, implying that we have more to lose if this decline continues. Thankfully, this also means that there may be more to gain by rebuilding stocks. For the global community, a solution could therefore be to provide the FAO the required funds to more intensively assist member countries in submitting better and more comprehensive fishery statistics, especially statistics that cover all fisheries components, and report data by sector25. Such improved statistics can then lead to better-informed policy changes for rebuilding stocks and maintaining (sea)food security. Alternatively, or in addition, FAO could team up with other groups (as was done for forestry statistics) to improve the fisheries statistics of member countries that often have fisheries departments with very limited human and financial resources. Ultimately, the only database of international fisheries statistics that the world has (through FAO) can be improved. The more rapid decline of fisheries catches documented here is a good reason for this. The catch reconstruction approach rests on two basic principles16: When ‘no data are available’ on a fishery that is known to exist, it is not appropriate to enter ‘NA’ or ‘no data’ into the database. Such entries will later be turned into a zero, which is a bad estimate of the catch of an existing fishery. This concern about the problematic ‘elegance of the number zero’ is also something that affects other scientific activities, such as climate modelling43; Rather, a best estimate should be inserted in all such cases, based on the fact that fishing is a social activity that is bound to throw a ‘shadow’ on the society in which it is embedded, and from which an approximate and conservative (but better than zero) estimate of catch can be derived if fishing of this type is known to occur (for example, from the seafood or the fuel consumed locally, or the number of vessels engaged in fisheries and the average catch rate of vessels of this type and so on). This approach addresses an inherent negative bias in national and, by extension, global catch data, although considerable uncertainty in catch data is likely to remain. Notably, when doing reconstructions, it became apparent that the perception of ‘no data’ being available was not always correct: the ‘social shadow’ yields hundreds of articles in the peer-reviewed and report literature with catch data, or data from which catch rates could be inferred, even for remote islands10. Also, countries may sometimes send to FAO a stripped down version of the national catch data their fisheries research institutes actually possess, and may even publish on their websites. What is covered here are both ‘coastal’ waters, defined as the waters within the EEZ (Supplementary Fig. 1) that countries have claimed since this was allowed under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), or which they could claim under UNCLOS rules, but have not (such as many countries around the Mediterranean), and the open oceans, or High Seas, that is, the waters beyond national jurisdiction (that is, beyond the EEZs). The delineations provided by the Flanders’ Marine Institute (VLIZ, see www.vliz.be) are used for our definitions of EEZs. Countries that have not formally claimed an EEZ are assigned areas equivalent to EEZs based on the basic principles of EEZs as outlined in UNCLOS (that is, 200 nm and/or mid-line rules). Note that we (a) include territorial waters within our EEZs; and (b) treat disputed zones (that is, EEZ areas claimed by more than one country) as being ‘owned’ by each claimant with respect to their fisheries catches. We treat EEZ areas prior to each country’s year of EEZ declaration as ‘EEZ-equivalent waters’ (with open access to all fishing countries during that time). If the year of EEZ declaration could not be determined (and for ‘EEZs’ that were derived by us for non-claimant countries), we assign the year 1982 as declaration year, that is, the year of conclusion of UNCLOS. We use different catch reconstruction approaches for EEZs (40% of the global ocean), and High Seas (60%), where the catches are mainly large pelagic fishes (notably tuna). Note that we also exclude the Caspian Sea from all considerations. Reconstructing time series of fisheries catch for all countries of the world from 1950 (the first year that FAO published its ‘Yearbook’ of global fisheries statistics) to 2010 was undertaken by fisheries ‘sectors’. However, because a standardized global definition of fishing sectors based on vessel size does not exist (for example, a vessel considered large-scale (industrial) in a developing country may be considered small-scale (artisanal) in developed countries), reconstructions utilize each country’s individual definitions for sectors, or a regional equivalent. These are described in each country reconstruction publication underlying this work. We consider four sectors: Industrial: large-scale fisheries (using trawlers, purse-seiners, longliners) with high capital input into vessel construction, maintenance and operation, and which may move fishing gear across the seafloor or through the water column using engine power (for example, demersal and pelagic trawlers), irrespective of vessel size. This corresponds to the ‘commercial’ sectors of countries such as the USA; Artisanal: small-scale fisheries whose catch is predominantly sold (hence they are also ‘commercial fisheries’), and which often use a large variety of generally static or stationary (passive) gears. Our definition of artisanal fisheries relies also on adjacency: they are assumed to operate only in domestic waters (that is, in their country’s EEZ). Within their EEZ, they are further limited to a coastal area to a maximum of 50 km from the coast or to 200 m depth, whichever comes first. This area is defined as the Inshore Fishing Area (IFA)44. Note that the definition of an IFA assumes the existence of a small-scale fishery, and thus unpopulated islands, although they may have fisheries in their EEZ (which by our definition are industrial, whatever the gear used), have no IFA; Subsistence: small-scale non-commercial fisheries whose catch is predominantly consumed by the persons fishing it, and their families (this may also include the ‘take-home’ fraction of the catch of commercial fishers, which usually by-passes reporting systems); and Recreational: small-scale non-commercial fisheries whose major purpose is enjoyment. In addition to the reconstructions by sector, we also assign catches to either ‘landings’ (that is, retained and landed catch) or ‘discards’ (that is, discarded catch), and label all catches as either ‘reported’ or ‘unreported’ with regards to national and FAO data. Thus, reconstructions present ‘catch’ as the sum of ‘landings’ plus ‘discards’. Discarded fish and invertebrates are generally assumed to be dead, except for the US fisheries where the fraction of fish and invertebrates reported to survive is generally available on a per species basis45. Due to a distinct lack of global coverage of information, we do not account for so-called under-water discards, or net-mortality of fishing gears46. We also do not address mortality caused by ghost-fishing of abandoned or lost fishing gear47. For commercially caught jellyfishes (particularly Rhizostomeae, but also other taxa), it has been shown that over 2.5 time more are caught than reported to FAO (mostly as ‘Rhizostoma spp.’)48. This factor is used to estimate missing catches of unidentified jellyfish. However, this additional catch is, pending further study, not allocated to any specific country or FAO area, and is thus counted only in the world’s total catch. We exclude from consideration all catches of marine mammals, reptiles, corals, sponges and marine plants (the bulk of the plant material is not primarily used for human consumption, but for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use). In addition, we do not estimate catches made for the aquarium trade, which can be substantial in some areas in terms of number of individuals, but relatively small in overall tonnage, as most aquarium fish are small or juvenile specimens49. Most catch reconstructions consist of six steps15: (1) Identification, sourcing and comparison of baseline catch times series, that is, (a) FAO reported landings data by FAO statistical areas, taxon and year; and (b) national or regional data series by area, taxon and year. Implicit in this first step is that the spatial entity be identified and named that is to be reported on (for example, EEZ of Germany in the Baltic Sea), something that is not always obvious, and which poses problems to some of our external collaborators, notably those in countries with a claimed EEZ overlapping with that of their neighbour. For most countries, the baseline data are the statistics reported by member countries to FAO. We treat all countries recognized in 2010 (or acting like independent countries with regards to fisheries) by the international community as having existed from 1950 to 2010. This is necessary, given our emphasis on ‘places’, that is, on time-series of catches taken from specific ecosystems. This also applies to islands and other territories, many of which were colonies, and which have changed status and borders since 1950. For several countries, the baseline data are provided by international bodies. In the case of EU countries, the baseline data originate from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which maintains fisheries statistics by smaller statistical areas, as required given the Common Fisheries Policy of the EU. A similar area is the Antarctic waters and surrounding islands, whose fisheries are managed by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), where catch data are available by relatively small statistical areas50. When FAO data are used, care is taken to maintain their assignment to different FAO statistical areas for each country (Supplementary Fig. 1), as they often distinguish between strongly different ecosystems. For example, the Caribbean Sea versus the coast of the Eastern Central Pacific in the case of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. For each maritime country, the area covered extends from the coastline to the edge of the EEZ, including any major coastal lagoons connected to the sea, and the mouths of rivers, that is, estuaries. However, freshwaters are excluded. (2) Identification of sectors (for example, subsistence, recreational), time periods, species, gears and so on, not covered by (1), that is, missing data components. This is conducted via literature searches and consultations with local experts. This step is one where the contribution of local co-authors and experts is crucial. Potentially, all four sectors defined by us can occur in the marine fisheries of a given coastal country, with the distinction between large-scale and small-scale being the most important25. For any entity, we check whether catches originating from the four sectors were included in the reported baseline of catch data, notably by examining their taxonomic composition, and any metadata, which were particularly detailed in the early decades of the FAO ‘Yearbooks’51. The absence of a taxon known to be caught in a country or territory from the baseline data (for example, cockles gleaned by women on the shore of an estuary)26 can also be used to identify a fishery that has been overlooked in the official data collection scheme, as can the absence of reef fishes in the coastal data of a Pacific Island state10. To avoid double counting, tuna and other large pelagic fishes, unless known to be caught by a local small-scale fishery (and thus in the past not likely reported to a Regional Fisheries Management Organization or RFMO), are not included in this reconstruction step (see below under ‘High Seas and other catches of large pelagic fishes’). Finally, if gears are identified in national data, but a gear known to exist in a given country is not included, then it can be assumed that its catch has been missed, as documented for weirs (hadrah) in the Persian Gulf52. (3) Sourcing of alternative information sources on missing sectors identified in (2), via literature searches (peer-reviewed and grey) and consultations with local experts. Information sources include social science studies (anthropology, economics and so on), reports, data sets and expert knowledge. The major initial source of information for catch reconstructions is governments’ websites and publications (specifically their Department of Fisheries or equivalent agency), both online and in hard copies. Contrary to what could be expected, it is often not the agency responsible for fisheries research and initial data collection that supplies the catch statistics to FAO, but other agencies, for example, statistical office or agency. As a result, much of the granularity of the original data (that is, catch by sector, by species or by gear) may be lost even before data are prepared for submission to FAO. Furthermore, the data request form sent by FAO each year to each country does not encourage improvements or changes in taxonomic composition, as the form that requests the most recent year’s data contains the country’s previous years’ data in the same composition as submitted in earlier years. This encourages the pooling of detailed data at the national level into the taxonomic categories inherited through earlier (often decades old) FAO reporting schemes, as was discovered, for example, for Bermuda in the early 2000s (ref. 53). Thus, by getting back to the original data, much of the original granularity can be regained during reconstructions. Additional sources of information on national catches are international organizations such as FAO, ICES or SPC (Secretariat of the Pacific Community), or a Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) such as NAFO (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization), or CCAMLR54, or current or past regional fisheries development and/or management projects (many of them launched and supported by FAO), such as the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem project (BOBLME). All these organizations and projects issue reports and publications describing—sometimes in considerable details—the fisheries of their member countries. Another source of information is the academic literature, now widely accessible through Google Scholar. A good source of information for the earlier decades (especially the 1950s and 1960s) for countries that were part of former colonial empires (especially British or French) are the colonial archives in London (British Colonial Office) and the ‘Archives Nationales d'Outre-Mer’, in Aix-en-Provence, and the publications of ORSTOM (Office de la recherche scientifique et technique d’outre-mer), for former French colonies. A further source of information and data are non-fisheries sources, including household and/or nutritional surveys, which are occasionally used for estimating unreported subsistence catches. Our global network of local collaborators is also crucial in this respect, as they have access to key data sets, publications and local knowledge not available elsewhere, often in languages other than English. Supplementary Figure 2 shows a plot of the publications used for slightly over 110 reconstructions against their date of publication. Although, recent publications predominate, older publications firmly anchor the 1950s catch estimates of many reconstructions. On average, around 35 unique publications were used per reconstruction (not counting online sources and personal communications). Potential language bias is taken seriously in the Sea Around Us, to ensure that data are collated in languages other than English. Besides team members who read Chinese, others speak Arabic, Danish, Filipino/Tagalog, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish. To deal with other languages, research assistants are hired who speak, for example, Korean or Malay/Indonesian. We also rely on our multilingual network of colleagues and friends throughout the world, for example, for Greek or Thai. While it is true that English has now become the undisputed language of science55, other languages are used by billions of people, and assembling knowledge about the fisheries of the world is not possible without the capacity to explore the literature in languages other than English. (4) Development of data ‘anchor points’ in time for each missing data item, and expansion of anchor point data to country-wide catch estimates. ‘Anchor’ points are catch estimates usually pertaining to a single year and sector, and often to an area not exactly matching the limits of the EEZ or IFA in question. Thus, an anchor point pertaining to a fraction of the coastline of a given country may need to be expanded to the country as a whole. For expansion, we use fisher or population density, or relative IFA or shelf area as raising factor, as appropriate given the local condition. In all cases, we consider that case studies underlying or providing the anchor point data may had a case-selection bias (for example, representing an exceptionally good area or community for study, compared with other areas in the same country), and thus use raising factors very conservatively. (5) Interpolation for time periods between data anchor points, either linearly or assumption based for commercial fisheries, and generally via per capita (or per fisher) catch rates for non-commercial sectors. Fisheries are often difficult to govern, as they are social activities involving multiple actors. In particular, fishing effort is often difficult to reduce, at least in the short term. Thus, if anchor points are available for years separated by multi-year intervals, it usually will be more reasonable to assume that the underlying fishing activity continues in the intervening years with no data. We tread this ‘continuity’ assumption as a default proposition. Exceptions to such continuity assumptions are major environmental impacts such a hurricanes or tsunamis56, or major socio-political disturbances, such as military conflicts or civil wars57, which we explicitly consider with regards to the use of raising factors and the structure of time series estimates. In such cases, our reconstructions mark the event through a temporary change (for example, decline) in the catch time series, which is documented in the text of each catch reconstruction. At the very least, this provides pointers for future research on the relationship between fishery catches and natural catastrophes or conflicts. We note that the absence of such signals (such as a reduction in catch for a year or two) in the officially reported catch statistics for countries having experienced a major natural or socio-political disturbance can be a sign that their official catch data may not accurately reflect what occurs on the ground. This contributes to the emergence of ‘poor numbers’40. Overall, our reconstructions assume—when no information to the contrary is available—that commercial catches (that is, industrial and artisanal) can be linearly interpolated between anchor points, while non-commercial catches (that is, subsistence and recreational) can generally be interpolated between anchor points using non-linear trends in human population numbers or number of fishers over time (via per capita rates). Radical and rapid effort reductions as a result of an intentional policy decision and implementation do not occur widely. One example we are aware of is the trawl ban of 1980 in Western Indonesia58. The ban had little or no impact on official Indonesian fisheries statistics for Western Indonesia, another indication that these statistics may have little to do with the realities on the ground. FAO hints at this being widespread in the Western Central Pacific and the Eastern Indian Ocean (the only FAO areas where reported catches appear to be increasing) when they note that ‘while some countries (i.e., the Russian Federation, India and Malaysia) have reported decreases in some years, marine catches submitted to FAO by Myanmar, Vietnam, Indonesia and China show continuous growth, i.e., in some cases resulting in an astonishing decadal increase (e.g., Myanmar up 121 percent, and Vietnam up 47 percent)’.42 (6) Estimation of total catch times series. A reconstruction is completed when the estimated catch time series derived through steps 2–5 are combined and harmonized with the reported catch of step 1. Generally, this results in an increase of the overall catch, but several cases exist where the reconstructed total catch is lower than the reported catch. The best documented case of this is that of mainland China14, whose over-reported catches for local waters in the Northwest Pacific are compensated for by under-reported catches taken by Chinese distant water fleets fishing elsewhere. In the 2000s, Chinese distant water fleets operated in the EEZs of over 90 countries, that is, in most parts of the world’s oceans5. Harmonizing reconstructed catches with the reported baselines goes hand-in-hand with documenting the entire reconstruction procedure. Thus, every reconstruction is documented and published, either in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, or as detailed technical reports in the publicly accessible and indexed Fisheries Centre Research Reports series or the Fisheries Centre Working Paper series, or other regional organization reports (Supplementary Table 5). Several reconstructions were conducted in the mid- to late 2000s, when official reported data (that is, FAO statistics or national data) were not available to 2010 (refs 15, 59). All these cases are updated to 2010, in line with each country’s individual reconstruction approach to estimating missing catch data. Thus, all reconstructions are brought to 2010 to ensure identical time coverage (Supplementary Table 5). Since these six points were originally proposed, a seventh point has come to the fore that cannot be ignored10: (7) Quantifying the uncertainty associated with each reconstruction. In fisheries research, catch data are rarely associated with a measure of uncertainty, at least not in the form resembling confidence intervals. This may reflect the fact that the issue with catch data is not a lack of precision (that is, whether we could expect to produce similar results upon re-estimation), but about accuracy, that is, attempting to eliminate a systematic bias, a type of error which statistical theory does not really address. We deal with this issue through a procedure related to ‘pedigrees’60 and the approach used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to quantify the uncertainty in its assessments61. The authors of the reconstructions are asked to attribute a ‘score’ expressing their evaluation of the quality of the time series data to each fisheries sector (industrial, artisanal and so on) for each of the three time periods (1950–1969, 1970–1989 and 1990–2010). These ‘scores’ are (1) ‘very low’, (2) ‘low’, (3) ‘high’ and (4) ‘very high’ (Table 1). There is a deliberate absence of an uninformative ‘medium’ score, to avoid the effective ‘non-choice’ that this option would represent. Each of these scores is assigned a percentage uncertainty range (Table 1). Thereafter, the overall mean weighted percentage uncertainty (over all countries and sectors) was computed (Fig. 1). We define foreign catches as taken by vessels of a maritime state in the EEZ, or EEZ-equivalent waters of another coastal state. Based on our definition of sectors, all foreign fishing in the waters of another country is deemed to be industrial in nature. As the High Seas legally belong to no one (or to everyone), there can be no ‘foreign’ catches in the High Seas. Prior to UNCLOS, and the declaration of EEZs by maritime countries, foreign catches were illegal only if conducted without explicit permission within the territorial waters of such countries (generally 12 nautical miles). Since the declarations of EEZs by the overwhelming majority of maritime countries, foreign catches are considered illegal if conducted within the EEZ but without access being granted by the coastal state. A distinct exception is the EU, whose waters are managed by a ‘Common Fisheries Policy’, which implies a multilateral ‘access agreement’. Access permission can be tacit and based on historic rights (‘observed’ access), or more commonly in the form of explicit access agreements and involving compensatory payment for the coastal state. The Sea Around Us, building on previous work by FAO62, has created a database of such access and agreements, which is used to allocate the catches of distant-water fleets to the waters where they were taken. This information is then harmonized with the catches reported by FAO for countries fishing outside their country’s ‘home’ FAO areas, which always identifies this catch as distant-water industrial catch (see below for tuna catches reported to RFMOs). In line with INTERPOL and others63, we define illegal fishing as foreign fishing within the EEZ waters of another country without a permission to access these resources. We do not treat domestic fisheries’ violations of ‘fishing regulations’ as ‘illegal’. In general, our reconstruction method cannot readily distinguish between legal and illegal foreign fishing, as we do not necessarily know about all access agreements5,6. Thus, our data only pertain to ‘reported’ versus ‘unreported’ status, irrespective of legality of foreign fleets in a host country5. However, for around two dozen countries (mainly in West Africa) where the number of illegally operating vessels could be inferred, the fleet size can be multiplied by appropriate catch per unit of effort rates, leading to an estimate of illegal catch in these EEZs. Nominal landings data. To date, there is no single, publicly available data set presenting industrial landings of tuna and large pelagic fishes for the entire world that is separate from the amalgamated FAO statistics, despite these fisheries being among the most valuable in the world64. Here, we first compile nominal industrial landings of tuna and other large pelagic fish caught either in the High Seas or within EEZs by fishing gear, taxon, countries and statistical reporting areas from data published by Regional Fisheries Management Organizations. Second, we use partially spatialized landings data provided by staff of the French ‘Institut de recherche pour le développement’ to spatially pre-assign the nominal landings data derived from RFMOs (Supplementary Table 6). For each ocean, the nominal landings data are spatialized according to reported proportions in the previously spatialized data (Supplementary Table 6). For example, if the nominal data reports France catching 100 tonnes of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in 1983 using longlines, but the spatial data only present 85 tonnes of yellowfin tuna reported in 1983 by France using longlines in four separate statistical cells, the nominal 100 tonnes for France are split into these four spatial cells according to their reported proportion of catch in the spatial dataset. This matching of the nominal and spatial records is done over a series of successive refinements, with the first being the best-case scenario, in which there are matching records for year, country, gear and taxon. The last refinement is the worst-case scenario, in which there are no matching records except for the year of catch. For example, if Sri Lanka reports 100 tonnes of yellowfin tuna caught in 1983 using longlines, but there are no spatial records for any country catching yellowfin tuna in 1983, the nominal 100 tonnes for Sri Lanka are split into spatial cells according to their reported proportions of total catch of any species and gear in 1983. The end result is a baseline landings database containing all matched and spatialized catch records, which sum to the original nominal catch tonnages. Discards. A review of the literature for each ocean provided limited country- and fleet-specific discard data. Therefore, we average the discard rates across the entire time period and apply these to the region of origin of the fleet (for example, East Asia or Western Europe), rather than the actual country of origin of the fleet. Discards were spatialized in conjunction with nominal landings data. Ultimately, the total catch extracted from a given area, such as a given EEZ or EEZ-equivalent waters, or high seas waters within a given FAO area is computed as the sum of three data layers: (1) the reconstructed domestic catches within home EEZs (‘Layer 1’ data); (2) the derived catch by foreign fleets (‘Layer 2’ data); and (3) the tuna and other large pelagic fishes caught in the High Seas and in EEZs (‘Layer 3’ data). The references and web-links of the contributions documenting the catch reconstructions that went into the re-estimation of the global catch of marine fisheries are documented in Supplementary Table 5. Altogether, 273 EEZs (or EEZ ‘components’) were covered in 247 catch reconstructions, which had 103 unique first authors and 279 unique co-authors in over 50 countries. All data presented here are also deposited in the Dryad Digital Depository (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.4s4t1). To examine if significant breakpoints exist in the catch data time series of both reconstructed total catches and reported catches that may illustrate a change in trends of catches over time (that is, a change in the slope), we analyse the time series trajectories using segmented regression21. For both the reconstructed as well as reported time series, we identify two breakpoints, being 1967 and 1996, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). These breakpoints suggest a change in regression slope, with the second breakpoint suggesting a trend reversal. This was validated by testing for a significant difference-in-slope parameter using the Davies test65, which tests for a non-zero difference-in-slope of a segmented regression relationship.

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Google,"Bluefin, Inc."," For decades Japan has been the final stop of an Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna supply chain riddled with fraud, criminal misconduct, and lack of oversight.  Mount Fuji rises across the bay from the 16th century port of Shimizu — a sight fit for a post card. The town has seen better days — its businesses shuttered, fishing boats driven into bankruptcy, and the only department store closed. But the city’s core business — marine and overland trade — has assured its survival. Shimizu is the primary port of landing for tuna in Japan. Hundreds of tons of tuna arrive here daily from all over the world, but none has the allure of the giant Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, a fish that once caught is nurtured for months at sea ranches in the Mediterranean to increase its fat content — and its yen value. Once considered a low-class dish, today the Atlantic bluefin is favored by sushi eaters across Japan. A single large fish can fetch more than $100,000 at market. So last year, when Japanese customs decided to stop the importation of more than 3,500 tons of Eastern Atlantic bluefin, the global tuna industry paused for a moment in disbelief. Instead of quickly being trucked to Tokyo’s Tsukiji market and other distribution centers, huge consignments of the bluefin were held in deep-freeze storage warehouses in Shimizu and other cities throughout Japan. The reason: officials suspected the fish were illegally caught. What’s extraordinary about the case is not so much the potential crimes involved — fraudulent paperwork and fish caught above national quotas — but that the Japanese were finally cracking down on a notoriously off-the-books trade. For decades Japan has been the final stop of an Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna supply chain riddled with fraud, criminal misconduct, and lack of oversight. European and North African fleets grossly overfished in the Mediterranean, fattening ranches became centers for the laundering of tuna, and officials from Europe to Japan looked the other way, while stocks of one of the most valued sea creatures were depleted with increasingly little hope of recovery. The lack of accountability created a massive black market, according to a seven-month inquiry by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. More than one out of three Eastern Atlantic bluefin caught between 1998 and 2007 was fished illegally, ICIJ found, feeding an illicit market worth $400 million a year. During some years, Japan’s bluefin supply exceeded the legal quotas of Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna by 50 percent, say industry veterans. “When the quota was 21,500 tons, in actual fact about 34,000 tons came to Japan,” said Koji Hayashi, trading manager at Shimizu-based Try Inc., the second largest distributor of frozen bluefin tuna in Japan. So plentiful were the fish, Hayashi recalled, that prices plummeted. Three-quarters of the world’s bluefin tuna end up in the country’s restaurants, convenience stores and markets, while the rest goes to Europe and the U.S. Some of Japan’s leading trading houses and seafood companies, led by Mitsubishi Corporation, sit atop well-oiled structures that move the fish from the tuna ranches in the Mediterranean to the Japanese dinner table — an intricate web of wholesalers, brokers, importers, and retailers. For the Japanese, history may be repeating itself. Just four years ago, an official investigation by Japan and Australia uncovered massive Japanese illegal catches and laundering of southern bluefin tuna, a sister species to the Atlantic bluefin. The investigation was a huge embarrassment for Japan, forcing it to overhaul its fishery management system. In the Mediterranean, even more drastic reforms will likely be needed, experts say. Earlier this year, Japan led an effort to defeat a proposal to list Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna under CITES — the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species — a move that would have banned the bluefin trade. Instead, Japanese officials insist the fishery should continue to be regulated by the Madrid-based International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), a body with 47 member states and the EU that is widely faulted for the dire state of the bluefin stock. “The stock of bluefin tuna, by far the most valued tuna species, has been so heavily overfished in recent times that its collapse has become a very serious and threatening possibility,” admitted ICCAT Chairman Fabio Hazin at a 2008 meeting of the industry and the commission in Tokyo. “The Commission’s inability to halt the decline of the bluefin tuna stocks for the past years has seriously jeopardized its credibility, raising grave concerns about its actual competence to manage the tuna stocks under its mandate.” In 2008, Japan supported ICCAT’s efforts to develop a new system to track bluefin from vessel to market, the Bluefin Tuna Catch Document Scheme (BCD). Through this program, each catch gets a unique identifying number that accompanies it through its months-long journey from the vessels to the ranches and to its final destination. Along the way, players must fill out forms and provide timely information on the size of the catch, the vessels and ranches involved, and even the weight of the fish. In fact, it was irregularities in these documents that raised concerns among Japanese officials about potential illegal shipments in 2009. Information was missing, dates didn’t match, and discrepancies in weight and number of fish suggested that illegalities could have occurred at the ranches. For example, documents showed that some ranches had killed more fattened tuna than they originally took in — an impossibility, given that bluefin do not reproduce in captivity. “We said, ‘This is nonsense!’” stated Masanori Miyahara, Japan’s ICCAT chief delegate, whose colleagues demanded explanations from EU officials about the discrepancies. “If they couldn’t make an explanation as to the legality of the fish, we said, ‘Then don’t bring it to us.’” ICIJ gained access to the BCD database through an ICCAT member country and found that the data is full of holes, making it nearly impossible for regulators to track the trade from vessel to market as the program originally intended. For example, at least 96 records of bluefin shipments to Japan in 2008 and 2009— equivalent to 5,000 tons — could not be traced back to a ranch or vessel in the database. Frozen bluefin tuna landing at Shimizu and other ports are trucked at temperatures of minus 55 C to major markets throughout Japan, including Tsukiji — a landmark in central Tokyo and the world’s largest seafood market. More than 450 species of fresh, frozen, and processed seafood are offered on any given day at the market. Fish valued at $5.2 billion flowed through Tsukiji in 2009, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. With operations leased out to seven wholesalers and more than 700 intermediary wholesalers who deal everything from flowers and chicken eggs to Japanese pickles, the giant, sprawling market can be a busy place. Early morning visitors are likely to take in fast-paced auctions that run via a system of nods, winks, and arcane signs mostly unintelligible to outsiders, while unique turret trucks buzz around a maze of puddle streaked alleys. Auctions may be the most visible sign of economic activity surrounding tuna, but today nearly all of the frozen and farmed bluefin entering Japan is sold by wholesalers directly to buyers. Japan’s big trading houses and fishing companies control most of the complex trading structure that moves bluefin from Mediterranean ranches to Tsukiji and other large markets, and from there to food stores and restaurants across Japan. As the Japanese developed a taste for toro, the fatty belly flesh of the bluefin, companies ranging from corporate giants Mitsubishi and Sojitz to seafood traders like Maruha became instrumental to the ranching business that ballooned in the Mediterranean in the mid-1990s. The Japanese teamed up with local partners from Spain to Croatia, financing fishing campaigns in advance, providing technical support, and underwriting loans for ranches. “They invest in all of that, and in the end they are the bosses,” observed Dalibor Kustura, a Croatian bluefin fisherman referring to Japanese interests in Mediterranean ranches. “They sell fish and everything. They are not owners, but they are owners.” With Japanese support, ranching dramatically changed the outlook of the bluefin industry in the Mediterranean. Instead of fishing, killing the bluefin and landing it at ports, the fish were towed live — sometimes for months — to sea ranches where they were fattened for as long as a year before being slaughtered and shipped in huge reefer vessels slated for Japan. Ranches spread across the Mediterranean, some in little regulated places like Cyprus, Turkey and Tunisia. With live fish in underwater pens, the ranches proved to be easy places to hide illegally caught bluefin. Indeed, the facilities quickly became a worrisome counterpart to the oversized and out-of-control Mediterranean fleets of purse seining vessels, ships equipped with giant nets capable of catching entire schools of the fish. Fleets routinely overfished their ICCAT-established quotas, sometimes by 100 percent, and ranches hid what they were doing. The ranches, in effect, “laundered” the extra fish by under-reporting the amount they took in and manipulating fattening ratios to account for the weight of the off-the-books catches, according to interviews with ranchers, inspectors and officials. Illegalities occurred, fishermen and officials said, because the demand for bluefin in Japan was so huge. “The Japanese needed it. They wanted more and more. Anything,” said a scientist who works closely with the bluefin industry in Croatia. Japan’s taste for tuna is a rather modern trend. In fact, up until the mid 19th century, the Japanese found the easily spoiled, bloody tuna fish unappealing. Some decades later, exposure to American-style foods during World War II created demand for fattier fish, say historians. But it wasn’t until the 1960s that Atlantic bluefin from North America entered the local market.  As concerns over Eastern Atlantic bluefin mounted in Europe, across the globe, Japanese officials were facing fallout from a similar pattern of illegal fishing in the southern oceans. Sparked by concern from Australia over dwindling stocks, a 2006 investigation commissioned by the Australian and Japanese governments revealed two decades of massive overfishing and laundering of southern bluefin tuna, a sister species to the Atlantic bluefin tuna that swims in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The findings of the 186-page investigative report, modestly titled Independent Review of Japanese Southern Bluefin Tuna Market Data Anomalies, were so damning that for years the study has been withheld from the public. Names of major wholesalers at Tsukiji were replaced with letters A through E. ICIJ obtained a copy of the confidential report. It shows that since 1985 Japan’s poor regulation and enforcement allowed a whopping 178,000 metric tons of southern bluefin overcatch to slip through the markets undetected. This off-the-books trade was valued at up to $6 billion. The fish had been laundered through a litany of methods. Some were imported as other, less valuable tuna species before being relabeled as bluefin at market. To avoid taxes, fish caught by foreign vessels were processed and brought to market as Japanese. Some imports were under-reported or not reported at all. The revelatory report was discussed semi-publicly twice: first, at a July 2006 special meeting in Canberra, Australia, of the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT), the regulatory body charged with protecting the stock; and again three months later at the annual commission meeting in Miyazaki, Japan. The mood at the Miyazaki meeting was particularly tense, attendees recall. “If this overcatch had not occurred, we estimate that the fishery would be five to six times larger than it is at present — well on target for our original goal to rebuild this fishery to 1980 levels by 2020,” said Glenn Hurry, then Australia’s CCSBT Commissioner at the Miyazaki meeting. “It actually makes the level of overcatch almost unforgivable.” Glenn Sant of the environmental group Traffic Oceania, who attended the Miyazaki meeting, said that for a long time the stocks of southern bluefin had been decreasing and there was pressure on all countries to constrain the catch. However, CCSBT members were concerned that there was neither enough monitoring of the market nor sharing of accurate information, and also that Japan had not shown much management initiative. “For many years Japan said that their catch was in conformity with the allowed quota,” Sant said. “But suddenly, it was put on the table how big their catch was.” At first, Japanese officials were critical of the findings. They responded that Tokyo would not “accept estimates blindly” and branded the results “one-sided” and of “low reliability,” according to the Miyazaki meeting report. Still, Japanese CCSBT delegates announced that their country had initiated “a drastic improvement” of the southern bluefin tuna management system. The new system set nontransferable quotas for individual vessels and mandated tagging for each landed bluefin to keep track of the trade. Equally important, the country’s 6,000 ton quota was cut by half for each of the next five years. The tension was so high over the study results that the CCSBT sealed the report, alleging it contained “commercially sensitive information.” Every researcher who took part in its drafting was required to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The secrecy even extended to scientists writing about the report’s findings. Tom Polacheck and Campbell Davies, two marine biologists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Australia’s main science agency, were only allowed to loosely reference the report in two 2007 papers they co-authored. “The documents are apparently confidential not because they reveal ‘commercially sensitive’ information,” Polachek told ICIJ, “but because they deal with a topic for which full disclosure and open discussion is unwelcome.”  The illegal practices, widespread overfishing, and lack of oversight were all patterns repeating themselves back in the Mediterranean, as the industry steadily depleted the Eastern Atlantic bluefin to feed Japanese demand. But stung by the southern bluefin report, and with environmentalists raising alarm about the Atlantic tuna, Japanese fisheries officials were finally paying attention. Matters reached a head in 2009 as talks of an impending CITES ban on bluefin trade intensified. Japan’s no-questions-asked policy finally began to change. Relying on the new Bluefin Tuna Catch Document Scheme, which gives each catch a unique identifying number allowing regulators to track a catch from vessel to market, Japanese officials started to closely scrutinize suspicious shipments. By the end of the year, they had taken the unprecedented step of refusing entry to more than 3,500 tons of Atlantic bluefin — a sixth of their entire supply that year. Among the issues flagged by the Japanese: holes and inconsistencies in the paperwork; bluefin that had been fattened so rapidly that the rates were biologically impossible; ranches that had reported killing more fish than they ever acquired; and bluefin that failed to meet the minimum legal size. Ranchers in the Mediterranean began to despair as they saw their prized bluefin pile up for months in deep-freeze storage houses in Japan. In some cases, shipments were refused even before they left the ranches. In the case of Malta, almost its entire bluefin production, worth up to €40 million, was halted, according to Malta Director of Fisheries Control Andreina Fenech. Japanese officials became overly meticulous and bureaucratic, ranchers complained. “They started refusing import approval of bluefin consignments for trivial issues that in the past were resolved with some mail correspondence with the importer,” said Apostolos Tzoumas, a rancher in Greece. Some ranchers and environmentalists interpreted Japan’s increased controls as a public relations campaign in the lead-up to the March 2010 CITES meeting. At CITES, amid international news coverage, Japan ultimately marshaled the support of a large number of countries, and defeated the bluefin ban by 68 votes to 20. But relations had grown particularly tense with EU fisheries officials, who had supported the CITES listing, albeit with conditions. With Japan refusing millions of dollars in precious Mediterranean bluefin, EU officials began giving profuse explanations to Tokyo as to the legality of the suspicious shipments. In June a delegation of EU officials went to Japan to smooth things over for their ranchers. Diplomacy worked — most of the stopped shipments have now been cleared by the Japanese, with the exception of about 800 tons that are still under investigation, according to Japanese officials. Whether posturing or not, Japanese officials are keeping a tough public stance. Asked about the responsibility of major Japanese traders in the bluefin trade irregularities, ICCAT delegate Miyahara, who works for the Fisheries Agency of Japan, said his colleagues have repeatedly conducted “guidance meetings” for the companies. “We have put the burner under them,” he noted. “If they cannot prove that the process by which they are producing fish is transparent and legal, then their fish will not be allowed into Japan.” Miyahara declined to name the major Japanese buyers of the stopped consignments. “People would get angry if I mentioned specific company names,” he explained. Mitsubishi, a corporate giant best known for trading in cars, steel and chemicals, owns subsidiaries that control about 40 percent of the bluefin market in Japan. When asked by ICIJ, Mitsubishi officials would neither confirm nor deny that they were the ultimate recipients of some of the stopped Mediterranean shipments. The company did say that the majority of the BCD paperwork for the bluefin caught in the Mediterranean in 2009 was “technically inadequate,” and that it had worked closely with the Japan Fisheries Agency to ensure that bluefin shipments to Japan “are compliant.” Starting in 2008, Mitsubishi has been putting out statements pledging to cut off any suppliers who are in violation of the law. While the pledges are welcomed by environmentalists, the complexities of the bluefin market and the many layers of companies in the supply chain help dilute responsibilities. “Their way of doing business is to draw a line between themselves and the site-related issues,” said Miyahara, speaking generally about large Japanese trading companies and distributors of bluefin tuna. Mitsubishi also denied to ICIJ a charge that has dogged the company for months: that the company has been stockpiling bluefin tuna to corner the market, and that it holds a two-year supply or more in deep-freeze storage houses in Japan. “In no way, shape or form do we speculate on [bluefin tuna] or ‘stockpile,’” reads a company statement. As of last year, Mitsubishi did appear to have an ample amount of bluefin at hand. ICIJ reporters in Croatia obtained the minutes of a meeting on July 9, 2009, between representatives of Mitsubishi, Drvenik Tuna — a Croatian ranch co-owned by Mitsubishi  — and the mayor of Marina Municipality, a coastal city in southern Croatia. Representing Mitsubishi was Yukio Shinano. According to the minutes, Shinano stated that his company had “enough warehoused and unsold tuna to last for a period of two years.”  He went on to explain that bluefin sales in the Japanese market were “very bad,” which had led to an increase in the company’s stocks of the fish. Whatever the size of their stockpiles, Japan’s marine traders hold the key to preserving the future of the bluefin tuna. Given their dominant role in the industry as financiers and consumers, much depends on whether they — and the Fisheries Agency of Japan — are serious about cracking down. Enlightened self-interest would suggest that the Japanese want to preserve one of their favorite fish, and, indeed, some environmental groups have held what they say are fruitful talks with Mitsubishi and other companies involved in the trade. And, at least for now, the Japanese are talking tough. In a September interview with ICIJ, ICCAT delegate Miyahara vowed that Japan would support “a temporary halt” of ranching in the Mediterranean if the illegal trade continues. Market forces may prove too powerful a draw, however. Loosely regulated North African and Turkish fleets are increasing their roles in supplying bluefin, and there are worrisome reports of Japan-bound fish being laundered through China. The Japanese also could prove reluctant to take the hard steps needed to preserve the bluefin, as environmentalists charge they have with whales. Despite years of widespread international criticism and harassment at sea, officials in Japan have been unyielding on the whaling issue, which is widely viewed there as an unfair attack on a long-standing tradition. And the market for whale meat is relatively small, worth about $85 million annually, whereas bluefin sushi and sashimi are a $500 million business. Still, the situation with bluefin is unlike that of whales, say Japanese environmentalists. “Bluefin tuna and whale issues are fundamentally different, with different histories, different production and different consumer structures,” said Aiko Yamauchi of WWF Japan. Miyahara, for his part, is reassuring. The Japanese, he says, could deal with a slowdown in the supply of bluefin, and give the prized fish time to recover. “The realization that it is not necessarily a good thing to be able to eat a lot of tuna at any one stage is spreading throughout Japan,” he said. “People would learn to be patient.” In the end, the fate of the bluefin depends on whether Tokyo is serious about cleaning up the bluefin trade. “These checks need to be made more severe,” said WWF’s Yamauchi. “We hope this new stance does not end in political posturing.” Be the first to know when we publish.

                                 Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR), Norway University of Patras, Greece Center of Marine Sciences, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, University of Algarve, Portugal Comprehensive catch data are fundamental to support the sustainable management of large pelagic fisheries. However, catch data reported by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) on behalf of its member countries currently under-represent the extent of these fisheries in the Indian Ocean. We reconstructed fisheries catches of large pelagic species for the Indian Ocean from 1950 to 2020, aiming to improve the comprehensiveness of existing reported data and to provide more ecologically relevant datasets for research and management uses. We reconstructed catches for 42 countries operating five major gear groups (longline, purse seine, gillnet, pole-and-line, and other gears) in the large pelagic fisheries. Reconstructed catches were 30% higher than the data reported by the IOTC. We demonstrated that distant-water fishing fleets historically dominated large-scale industrial fishing but were gradually replaced by fleets flagged to Indian Ocean rim countries. Our results also indicated an average discard rate of ~14% over the 1950-2020 period, primarily attributable to extensive discarding practices associated with longline and gillnet vessels. Reporting over time has improved only for tunas, whereas shark catches still remain under-reported, accounting for 51% of total unreported landings and discards in 2020. We confirmed substantial taxonomic aggregation in the data reported by the IOTC on behalf of its member countries, masking important patterns and trends and further complicating the sustainable management of exploited species in the Indian Ocean. We recommend substantially increased observer coverage and far better and stronger support by all member countries to improve the fisheries statistics in the IOTC. Large pelagic species, such as tunas, billfishes, and sharks, are of substantial commercial value, both for large- and small-scale fisheries around the world, and may have ecological implications due to the broad distribution and accessibility in surface and near-surface waters of these species (Schaefer et al., 2014; Bell et al., 2021). These species support a substantial industry and produce highly valued catches for many countries worldwide. Global catches from these fisheries exceeded 6.5 million tonnes in 2018, and tuna alone were valued at an estimated US$42 billion (FAO, 2020; McKinney et al., 2020). The market demand for large pelagic species continues to increase, as do trends in fishing mortality rates, with fisheries thought to be catching at least 10-15% of the global large pelagic adult biomass each year (Allen, 2010). Consequently, the global adult biomass of tunas and their relatives has at least halved over the past half century, leaving most populations at least fully exploited and limiting further expansion of catches in these fisheries (Juan-Jordá et al., 2011). Fisheries for large pelagic species have existed in the Indian Ocean for centuries, with artisanal fisheries primarily operating in coastal areas (Stequert and Marsac, 1986). Industrial fishing for large pelagic species began in the early 1950s, when European, Japanese, and Taiwanese longline fleets arrived in the Indian Ocean (Miyake et al., 2004). This arrival was driven by a shift in global fishing effort away from historically fully- or over-exploited regions in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean fishing grounds for large pelagic species. The Indian Ocean region has experienced a particularly steep increase in catches for large pelagic species over the past ten years, and by 2018 accounted for 32% of the total global reported catch of all tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) (Heidrich et al., 2022). Today, the Indian Ocean is home to the world’s second-largest fisheries for large pelagic species, providing 16% of the global tuna industry’s revenue (i.e., US$ 6.5 billion) in 2017 (Lecomte et al., 2017). Despite the perceived scale and economic importance of these fisheries, large tuna and billfishes account for only 7-8% of total ocean basin catches and 17% of all pelagic catches in the late 2010s in the entire Indian Ocean (Zeller et al., 2023a). Currently, local and foreign vessels operate in the Indian Ocean’s High Seas and within the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of the 36 countries and territories of the Indian Ocean rim as part of the fisheries for large pelagic species. The foreign fleets from countries outside the Indian Ocean region account for approximately 47% of the reported regional catch in 2020 (IOTC, 2021a; Li et al., 2021, https://www.iotc.org/data/datasets/latest/NC-ALL). The large- and small-scale fisheries for large pelagics in the Indian Ocean supply local and international export markets with various products, ranging from fresh fish landed and consumed locally to canned tuna and high-grade sashimi for international trade (Lecomte et al., 2017). The industrial fisheries sector share of catches is almost exclusively export-oriented and is thought to be dominated by foreign fleets or foreign beneficial ownership fleets (Ford et al., 2022). These highly industrialized distant-water fishing fleets (DWF), predominantly from developed countries outside the Indian Ocean region, directly compete with local fishing fleets, which provide an essential source of food and livelihood security for millions of people in coastal communities throughout the Indian Ocean (Doyle, 2018; Techera, 2018; Taylor et al., 2019; Karim et al., 2020). Among the countries involved in the fisheries for large pelagics in the Indian Ocean are some of the wealthiest countries in the world and some with the lowest per capita income (Llewellyn et al., 2016), which is a reflection of the extreme socio-economic diversity in the fishery. Globally, the large pelagic fisheries employ several million people directly, through fishing, and indirectly through employment in canneries, processing plants, and trade (Alder and Watson, 2007; Teh and Sumaila, 2013). Rapid human population growth and overall declining marine resources in the Indian Ocean have increased competition for pelagic fish among fishers, especially for the commercially important scombrid species: albacore (Thunnus alalunga), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), and bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). This competition, and the resulting growth in fishing effort, poses a significant challenge to sustainable fisheries management and economic viability in Indian Ocean rim countries (Kimani et al., 2009; WWF, 2020). The management and conservation of tunas and other large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean fall under the jurisdiction of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the designated tuna RFMO for the Indian Ocean. The IOTC is responsible for managing 16 tuna and other large pelagic species but also requires its member countries to collect data on the bycatch of non-targeted species that are affected by large pelagic fishing activities (IOTC, 2011a). Economic, institutional, and political factors such as international competition in trade, the transboundary nature of tuna stocks, gear diversity, scientific uncertainties, and geopolitical factors make it challenging to regulate and manage highly migratory species like tuna (Sinan and Bailey, 2020). Additionally, IOTC member countries protect their own national economic and political interests during negotiations, which can further challenge, limit or even derail the effectiveness and scope of management actions taken by the IOTC (FAO, 2016). The lack of capacity and resources in many IOTC member countries, such as strong Control, Monitoring, and Surveillance (CMS) mechanisms and effective flag state control over fishing vessels operating on the High Seas or in foreign EEZs, complicates the implementation and enforcement of effective measures for the sustainable management of large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean. (Cullis-Suzuki and Pauly, 2010; Gianni et al., 2011; Weaver et al., 2011; Pitcher and Cheung, 2013; Wright et al., 2015). Overall, there continues to be a general deficiency in stock assessments resulting from significant gaps in comprehensive fisheries data and scientific understanding across the region (Heidrich et al., 2022). Comprehensive and accurate catch data and fundamental biological data are paramount for understanding the stock status and trajectories of large pelagic species (McClenachan et al., 2012; Pauly and Zeller, 2016a), given their ecological, social, and economic importance in the Indian Ocean. However, the scale and extent of fishing impacts on these species are surprisingly uncertain, not least due to data collection challenges in the majority of Indian Ocean countries, driven by capacity and resource limitations to monitor the extensive fisheries for large pelagic species in many Indian Ocean rim countries (Kleisner et al., 2013; IOTC, 2019a; Martin and Shahid, 2021). In addition, DWF countries also pose a challenge to data accountability and completeness, driven by a lack of control and compliance by the flag state and an unwillingness to cooperate (Bateman, 2012; Pillai and Satheeshkumar, 2012). Consequently, the IOTC processes are hampered by a dearth of accurate data submissions by fishing countries and fleets, indicating profound quality issues in nationally and internationally assembled data (MRAG, 2019). Nationally collected data focus extensively or even exclusively on landings from major commercial fisheries and substantially underrepresent, misreport or completely lack comprehensive estimates on discards and illegal or unreported catches for bycatch species such as sharks, whose removal has significant implications for broader ocean ecosystem health (Trebilco et al., 2013; Lascelles et al., 2014). For example, in 2019, only 72% of the reported catches were deemed fully or partially complete, yet associated with poor quality, making their use for reliable stock assessments questionable (IOTC, 2019a). This lack of comprehensive reported catch data contributes to underestimating unreported landings and discards in these fisheries (IOTC, 2021b). It also results in a lack of publicly available, reliable data on the health of many exploited stocks in the Indian Ocean, with such a lack of public transparency and accountability posing a challenge to the management of these fisheries in the Indian Ocean (Heidrich et al., 2022). Despite the challenges of sustainably managing fisheries for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean and the documented overexploitation of some of the most economically and ecologically important target species in the region (e.g., yellowfin tuna), there remains significant debate about the implementation of catch quota reduction among member countries of the IOTC (Collette et al., 2021; Walker, 2021). Long-term catch histories are an essential component of stock assessments, particularly for species for which only data-limited stock assessment methods are available (Froese et al., 2017, Froese et al., 2018, Froese et al., 2020, Froese et al., 2021). Here, catch reconstructions can play a crucial role in filling such gaps, despite the potential for higher uncertainty levels (Pauly and Zeller, 2016a; Zeller et al., 2016; Pauly and Zeller, 2017). The IOTC has made efforts to improve national data collection systems in many of its member countries and to incorporate catch reconstructions as a viable method of complementing some previously incomplete data sets (OFC, 2007; OFC, 2010; OFC, 2013; Moazzam and Ayub, 2017; Moazzam et al., 2017). However, there are many cases where critical historical catches have gone unreported, as many countries were not collecting fishery statistics for the pre-1970 periods (IOTC, 2021b), thus, catch statistics in tuna RFMOs, including for the IOTC, suffer extensively from the ‘presentist bias’ (Zeller and Pauly, 2018). The current study reconstructs and examines catch data for large large pelagics in the Indian Ocean from 1950 to 2020. We generate comprehensive time-series estimates of catches missing from the reported landings baselines (i.e., estimates of unreported catches and discards). The reconstruction of catches for the large pelagic species fisheries in the Indian Ocean for 1950-2020 followed the general catch reconstruction approach outlined in Zeller et al. (2016). This well-established catch reconstruction approach was first implemented for coral reef and demersal fisheries in U.S. flag-associated Pacific Islands (Zeller et al., 2006; Zeller et al., 2007) and has since been applied to the fisheries in EEZs of every maritime country in the world (Pauly and Zeller, 2016a; Pauly and Zeller, 2016b). Furthermore, a synthesis review of reconstructed catch, as well as fishing effort data for the entire Indian Ocean basin, has recently been completed (Zeller et al., 2023a). However, this is the first study to comprehensively apply this approach to the fisheries for large pelagic species under the management purview of a tuna RFMO. The IOTC is an intergovernmental organization that, on behalf of its member countries, is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating scientific information, including catch and effort statistics relevant to the conservation and management of pelagic fish stocks in its Convention Area (Figure 1). We identified and sourced the IOTC’s publicly available reported catch records and used these as the reported baseline data to reconstruct the likely total catches of large pelagic species for the 1950-2020 period. We complemented these official records with comprehensive time-series estimates of unreported fisheries components, i.e., unreported landings and discards, as derived here using secondary data and information from the peer-reviewed and grey literature. Such secondary data and knowledge can help address existing data gaps when combined with conservative assumptions (Pauly and Zeller, 2016a; Zeller et al., 2016; Leitão et al., 2018). Figure 1 Map of the Indian Ocean region, including the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of the Indian Ocean rim countries (dark grey). The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) Convention Area, as applicable to the present study, is highlighted in blue and is comprised of FAO statistical areas 51 (Western Indian Ocean) and 57 (Eastern Indian Ocean). Fisheries for large pelagic species in the IOTC Convention Area range from small-scale, artisanal operations in coastal waters of Indian Ocean rim countries (Okemwa et al., 2023) to large-scale, industrial operations in the EEZs and international waters (High Seas) of the Indian Ocean (Sala et al., 2018; Carmine et al., 2020). The IOTC classifies vessels as industrial or artisanal by their overall length and area of operation. Industrial vessels include vessels with an overall length > 24 m regardless of their area of operation (EEZs or High Seas) or vessels with an overall length< 24 m fishing in areas outside their own EEZ. The IOTC defines artisanal fishing vessels as vessels ranging from non-mechanized pirogues that fish for subsistence to longline, gillnet, and purse seine vessels with inboard motors that undertake commercial operations exclusively in national waters (MRAG, 2019). Thus, currently, only around one-third of the reported IOTC catches for large pelagic species are classified as industrial (Figure S1, IOTC, 2014; MRAG, 2019). We considered the IOTC definition of artisanal as too simplistic and therefore adjusted this definition to better match the stricter definition used in the global Sea Around Us database system (Zeller et al., 2016). Thus, we divided the catches reported by the IOTC into industrial and artisanal sectors based on vessel size, type of gear used, and area of operation. The Sea Around Us defines the small-scale, artisanal fishing sector as vessels < 15 meters in length that operate solely in domestic waters and using fishing gear that is not actively moved through the water column using engine power (Martin, 2012; Zeller et al., 2016). This is the definition we used here for reported catch data reclassification. On the other hand, the large-scale industrial sector comprises vessels > 15 m operating active and passive gears in High Seas and EEZ waters. Furthermore, all vessels using gear that is actively dragged or towed through the water column using engine power were labeled as ‘industrial’ regardless of their vessel size (Martin, 2012). Sources used to reclassify parts of the IOTC-reported artisanal catches as industrial catches are given in Table S1. For the present study, we excluded from further consideration all catches of large pelagic species taken by the newly re-defined artisanal sector, which amounted to 23.7 million t (~24%) of total reported IOTC catches (Figure S1). This exclusion minimizes potential double-counting of truly small-scale sector catches of large pelagic species, given that pelagic catches by small-scale fisheries were addressed separately through country-specific catch reconstructions of domestic EEZ fisheries (Pauly and Zeller, 2016b). Thus, in the present study, we only address large-scale, industrial fisheries catches of large pelagic species, using the adjusted sectoral baseline outlined above. The large pelagic fisheries in the Indian Ocean can be divided into five main groups by general fishing gear types: longline, purse seine, gillnet, pole-and-line, and ‘other miscellaneous gears’, and these fisheries are conducted by 42 DWF and Indian Ocean rim countries. Some catches by the deep-freezing and fresh longline vessels and purse seine vessels flying various non-European flags are reported as ‘fishing country nei’ (fishing country not elsewhere included). We used information provided by the IOTC to disaggregate these catches, assuming an equal split of catches between countries in the respective ‘nei’ groups (Table S2). We used available information from the literature and observer studies to complement the reported IOTC baseline data with catch estimates of unreported fisheries components, those being unreported landed and discarded catch for every gear group for every country operating vessels in the Indian Ocean fisheries for large pelagics in a given year (Figure S2). We acquired and analyzed information from over 50 unique sources, including grey and peer-reviewed literature from independent and government entities, to generate data anchor points (sensu Zeller et al., 2016). These sources were used to conservatively estimate likely unreported catches over time (Tables S2–S7). We estimated unreported landed and unreported discarded catch separately, following the flowchart logic presented in Figure S2 (see Figure S3 for details). For gear-country combinations where no independent information was available, an average underreporting and discarding rate from a similarly operating gear and country was applied (see Tables S2–7 for details). Unreported landings were estimated back to either 1950, the start year of the reconstruction period, or the known start of a gear-country-specific fleet from the earliest available anchor point by assuming past catches changed differently for teleosts and elasmobranchs. This approach assumed that changes in historical fishery catches for large pelagic species are directly related to the target species group of the specific fishery. We derived ‘anchor point catch rates’ by converting estimates unreported catch from the literature into catch rates of unreported catch per tonne of reported catch. For example, if a source documents 20 tonnes of unreported catch of species x by gear y by country z in a fishery that reports 100 tonnes of species x by gear y by country z, the derived ‘anchor point catch rate’ is 20/100 tonnes = 20%. We carried the earliest anchor point for unreported catch rate (i.e., percentage of catch going unreported) back to the start year of the time series or gear-country combination (Figure S2). We then multiplied this rate with the corresponding underlying reported data to get total estimates of unreported landings for teleosts (UL1i,j,k, Figure S3A). Catches for elasmobranchs were estimated back from the earliest anchor point to the start year of the individual fishery, assuming that catch rates for elasmobranchs were 50% higher at the beginning of the given fishery compared to the earliest anchor point year (Figure S2). This was based on our assumption that elasmobranch landings are declining due to rapidly declining shark populations (Davidson et al., 2016). The catch rates were then interpolated for years between the earliest anchor point and the beginning of the given fishery. Unreported elasmobranch catches were then derived by multiplying these adjusted catch rates with the corresponding underlying reported data to get total estimates of unreported landings for elasmobranchs (UL1i,j,k, Figure S3A). We used simple linear interpolations to fill gaps between years with anchor points for a given gear-country combination for both teleosts and elasmobranchs (UL2i,j,k, Figure S3A). Thereby, we assumed the continuation of fishing between years of reported data rather than assuming that no reported data implied the cessation of the fishery (Zeller et al., 2016). We estimated unreported catches forward from the most recent anchor point on record by carrying the most recent unreported catch rate anchor point forward to 2020 unchanged. Thereafter, we multiplied the derived catch rate by the underlying reported data to the time series end year of 2020 (UL3i,j,k, Figure S3A), except for gear-country combinations where information on earlier cessation of the fishing activity was available (Figure S3A). We estimated discards separately for all gear-country combinations based on independent data and information sources for gear- and country-specific discarding practices (Tables S3–S8). We defined discards as the portion of the catch that is not retained on board during fishing operations and is returned to the sea, often dead or dying. Discards are explicitly excluded from the IOTC reported baseline data, but some discard data are collated in a separate database for the IOTC Working Party on Ecosystems and Bycatch (WPEB, https://www.iotc.org/WPEB/16/Data/12-ROS, IOTC, 2015). This exclusion of discarded catches in official data reporting is, unfortunately also consistent with international reporting of fisheries catches by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (Garibaldi, 2012; Zeller et al., 2018). Therefore, all discards estimated here were deemed unreported with respect to the officially reported baseline data as reported by the IOTC and hence by the FAO. We followed the same approach in estimating unreported discards (UD) for each gear-country combination for every given year (Figure S3B) as outlined above for estimating unreported landings (UL). We estimated discards using independently sourced discard rates and applied these to the total landed catch, being the sum of the reported plus unreported landings by country and gear group. We used discard-to-landings ratios from known years to estimate missing discards for years where no discard data were available. Further, we used discard rates from similarly operating fleets or countries where country- and gear-specific discard rates were unavailable (Tables S3–S8). We calculated the total unreported catch (UCi,j,k) of large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean (FAO areas 51 and 57; Figure 1) as the sum of unreported landings (ULi,j,k) and unreported discard (UDi,j,k), [Eq.1]: for gear i and country j in year k. We further calculated the total reconstructed catch (CRi) for each gear-country combination [Eq.2]: where UCi,j,k and RCi,j,k are the unreported catch and reported catch by gear i and country j in year k, respectively (Figure S3C). The taxonomic composition of the estimated unreported landings and discards was primarily derived from the reported industrial large pelagic fisheries catch composition, i.e., from the IOTC reported baseline data. This composition was held constant for years when reported landings were available. We used the taxonomic composition of catches from the nearest available anchor point year for each gear-country combination to account for the taxonomic composition for years in which we filled data gaps. We linearly interpolated the proportion of total catches for each taxonomic group between anchor points to account for gaps in the taxonomic composition of catches between anchor points. We further divided the catches into two categories according to their taxonomic resolution, where the taxonomically finely-resolved catches included those reported at the species level, and the taxonomically more coarsely-resolved catches included those reported at the genus, family, order, and higher levels, hereafter referred to as species-level groups and higher-pooled groups, respectively. We applied the IOTC taxonomic composition of shark catches to the reconstructed catches to disaggregate the higher-pooled taxa group ‘sharks various nei’, one of the largest higher-pooled groups in the IOTC reported database (Table S9, Martin et al., 2017). We recognize that not all non-retained catches (i.e., discards) would taxonomically resemble retained landings and emphasize that future research is needed to address the detailed taxonomic composition of discarded catches. We estimated uncertainty associated with the total reconstructed data (including reported and unreported catch components) following a data reliability scoring approach adopted from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Mastrandrea et al., 2010) as outlined in Zeller et al. (2016) and as detailed in Pauly and Zeller (2017), Table S10. We assigned data reliability scores and the associated percentage uncertainty bounds based on a careful evaluation of the trust in the underlying secondary data and information sources used, separately for each fishing gear–country combination for both industrial landed and discarded catches for each of 4 time periods (1950 – 1969, 1970 – 1989, 1990 – 2009, and 2010 - 2020). The data reliability scores range from 1 to 4 (Table S10), with 1 representing the lowest reliability (highest uncertainty, ± 50%) and 4 representing the highest reliability (lowest uncertainty, ± 10%). We derived total data reliability scores and the associated percentage uncertainty bounds for each of the four periods based on the catch-weighted score averages for each category (gear–country combination). Visual examination of the total reconstructed catch time series suggested distinct periods with different trends. We therefore carried out a segmented regression analysis on the total reconstructed catch time series using the segmented package in R (Muggeo, 2008) to identify potential breakpoints in the time series trend. We included 71 years of catch data (1950-2020) in the calculations to determine if the time series could be described by one or several trend line patterns. The total reconstructed catches, i.e., the sum of reported landings plus unreported landings and unreported discards, for large pelagic species caught by industrial fisheries in the Indian Ocean between 1950 and 2020 were > 29% higher than the adjusted industrial catches reported by the IOTC on behalf of its member countries (Figure 2A, Table S11). Total industrial catches of large pelagic species increased gradually from around 44,000 t·year-1 in the early 1950s to 442,000 t·year-1 by 1982, after which catches increased strongly during the 1980s and 1990s to a peak of ~1.7 million t in 2005 (Figure 2A, Table S11). After 2005, catches declined to around 1.2 million t by 2010 before rebounding to average annual catches of approximately 1.4 million t·year-1 by 2020 (Figure 2A). The time series data suggested three distinct periods of time series trends in catches, as supported by a segmented regression (Figure S4). These periods were 1950 – 1982, 1983 – 1999, and 2000 – 2020 (Figures 2A, S3). Figure 2 Total reconstructed large pelagic fisheries catches for the Indian Ocean by reporting status from (A) 1950 to 2020 with data reliability (uncertainty) bounds indicated as catch-weighted averages for 1950 - 1969, 1970 – 1989, 1990 – 2009, and 2010 – 2020 time spans; and (B) by analytically identified period (1950 – 1982, 1983 – 1999, and 2000-2020), where the pie chart size indicates the average amount of reconstructed catches per period. The relative level of catch reporting was lowest during the earliest period (1950-1982), with only around 61% of total catches reported (Figure 2B). Reporting levels seemed to improve during the second period (1983-1999) to approximately 76% of total catches and further improved in the most recent period, with currently around 79% of total catches assessed as reported (Figure 2B). Unreported catches were dominated by unreported landed catches rather than discards in the earlier decades, accounting for 27% and 12% of total catches, respectively (Figure 2B, Table S11). The relative contribution of unreported landings to total unreported catches decreased during the second and third periods, and by the most recent period (2000-2020) unreported landings accounted for around 11% of total catches (Figure 2B, Table S11). Discards increased from about 37,500 t·year-1 in the early 1950s to a peak of around 154,000 t·year-1 in 1999 before declining slightly to approximately 149,700 t·year-1 by the end of the third period (Figure 2A). Thus, discards accounted for around 12% of total reconstructed catches in the early period, which decreased to about 10% in recent years (Figure 2B). The uncertainty around the total reconstructed catch estimates derived via our data reliability scoring was highest in the earlier decades (the 1950s and 1960s), driven by the general scarcity of data and information for all gear groups during that time, leading to lower data reliability scores and thus more extensive uncertainty ranges of ±19.5% of the total reconstructed catch for the earlier decades (Table S12). The subsequent decades from 1970 – 2020 had better data and information sources, resulting in lower uncertainty bounds of ±10% of the total reconstructed catch (Table S12). Nearly 56% of reported IOTC baseline catch data was labeled as ‘artisanal’ by the IOTC, including catches taken in high seas waters (Figure S1). On average, we reclassified around 188,000 t·year-1 of the reported ‘artisanal’ catches as being industrial sector catches, as the definition for the artisanal sector used globally by the Sea Around Us is spatially restrictive, i.e., artisanal and other small-scale fishing can only occur within inshore waters within a country’s EEZ (Chuenpagdee et al., 2006; Zeller et al., 2016). This reclassification reduced the artisanal sector component from 58% prior to sectoral reallocation to around 46% of reported catches in the Indian Ocean fisheries for large pelagic species in 2020 (Figure S1). The reclassified artisanal catches were not included in our analyses since they have already been addressed with country-specific, EEZ-scale catch reconstructions that emphasize small-scale fisheries, including for tuna and other pelagic species (Pauly and Zeller, 2016a; Zeller et al., 2016; Zeller et al., 2023b). Historically, total industrial catches of large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean were taken primarily by longline gears, which dominated during the first two decades (Figure 3A). More recently, however, gillnet and purse seine gears account for the majority of total industrial catches, accounting for 36% (~ 514,000 t·year-1) and 35% (~ 500,000 t·year-1) of total catches, respectively, in the late 2010s, while longlines account for only around 19% or ~ 280,000 t·year-1 (Figure 3A, Table S13). Pole-and-line gear made only minor contributions across the entire Indian Ocean, accounting for around ~119,000 t·year-1 or 8% of total catches in recent years (Figure 3A). Both unreported landings and unreported discards were dominated by longline and gillnet gears, with longline unreported landings and discards decreasing over time (Figures 3B, S5, Table S14). Gillnet gears showed a steady increase of unreported landings and discards from ~27% during 1950-1982 to ~43% in 2000-2000 (Figures 3B, S5, Table S14). In contrast, purse seine, pole-and-line, and ‘other’ gear types accounted for much smaller shares of unreported catches (Figures 3B, S5, Table S13). Purse seine gears, however, showed a slight increase in the relative contribution of discards to total reconstructed catches from the initial period of purse seine development (1983-1999, 11%) to the most recent period (13%, Figure 3B). Figure 3 Total reconstructed large pelagic fisheries catches for the Indian Ocean by major gear group (A) from 1950 to 2020; and (B) by analytically identified period (1950 – 1982, 1983 – 1999, and 2000-2020) and reporting status, where the pie chart size indicates the average amount of reported landings, unreported landings, and unreported discards per period. Large tunas dominated the Indian Ocean’s large pelagic fisheries catches, accounting for 73% of total catches between 1950 and 2020 (Figure 4A). Catches of tuna taxa increased from around 110,000 t·year-1 during the 1950s to about 307,000 t·year-1 in the early 1980s before growing strongly and steadily to a peak catch of over 1.3 million t in 2005 (Figure 4A, Table S15). In recent years, i.e., 2018-2020, catches of tuna taxa averaged just under 1.2 million t·year-1 (Figure 4A). The second most commonly caught taxonomic group was pelagic sharks, which accounted for 13% of total catches over the entire period (Figure 4A). Catches of sharks increased more or less steadily throughout the earlier decades, peaking in the early 2000s at around 210,000 t·year-1, and have seemingly declined in recent years to approximately 86,000 t·year-1 by 2020 (Figure 4A). Billfishes (i.e., marlins, etc.) account for around 5% to total catches over time, having peaked at about 93,000 t·year-1 in 2004 before declining to about 61,000 t·year-1 by 2020 (Figure 4A). Taxonomic categories that have seen steady increases in their catch contribution in recent years are the seerfishes (i.e., mackerels, etc.) and the ‘other’ taxonomic grouping (Figure 4A). Catches of seerfishes have more than doubled from an average of 43,000 t·year-1 in the 1980s and 1990s to around 89,000 t·year-1 by 2020, while ‘other’ taxa amounted to ~78,000 t in 2020 (Figure 4A). Figure 4 Total reconstructed large pelagic fisheries catches for the Indian Ocean by (A) major species groups from 1950 to 2020; (B) analytically identified period (1950 – 1982, 1983 – 1999, and 2000-2020) and reporting status, where the pie chart size indicates the average amount of reported landings, unreported landings, and unreported discards per period; and (C) Taxonomic composition of reconstructed total catches for the large pelagic fisheries catches for the Indian Ocean for 1950-2020. The category ‘other taxa; consists of 169 additional taxa with minor contributions to the overall catch. Tunas and sharks dominate the unreported catches, as unreported landings and unreported discards (Figure 4B). In the most recent period (1999-2020), tunas account for 51% (~82,000 t·year-1) of unreported landings and 69% (~94,000 t·year-1) of unreported discards (Figure 4B). Sharks have experienced a gradual increase in their relative share of unreported catches, especially among landings, having increased from 16% (~39,800 t·year-1) of unreported landings in the earliest period to ~29% (47,000 t·year-1) in the most recent period (Figure 4B). Discards appear to be heavily dominated by tuna taxa, accounting for 63-69% of total discards over time (Figure 4B, Table S16). Sharks accounted for a smaller proportion (15-18%) of total discards, which amounted to ~16,700 t·year-1 in the earliest period (1950-1982) and ~20,000 t·year-1 in the most recent period (Figure 4B, Table S15). Overall, however, the volume of unreported catches, i.e., landings and discards, of sharks steadily increased over time from ~19,700 t·year-1 during the earliest period (1950-1982) to ~67,000 t·year-1 in the most recent period (1999-2020), reaching ~22% of the total reconstructed shark catches in recent years (Figure S6, Table S16). Catch data reported by the IOTC on behalf of its member countries ranged from fine-scale taxonomic resolution at the species level, e.g., yellowfin tuna, to very coarse and uninformative pooled group taxonomic resolution, e.g., ‘tunas nei’ (‘tunas not elsewhere included’; Table S17). The taxonomic composition of the total reconstructed catches across all six fishing gear groups comprised 194 taxonomic categories, of which 136 were at the informative species level, accounting for ~93% (~1.3 million t·year-1) of the total reconstructed catch (Table S18). The remaining 7% (~81,000 t) of the catch that is not at the species level includes highly vulnerable taxa, such as sharks and rays, and non-targeted, associated, and dependent taxa (Table S18). Ten dominant taxa accounted for ~85% of the reconstructed catches and included Thunnus albacares (24%), Katsuwonus pelamis (20%), Thunnus obesus (11%), Carcharhinus falciformis (8%), Thunnus maccooyii (5%, mainly in the 1950s and 1960s), Thunnus tonggol (5%), Thunnus alalunga (4%), Scomberomorus commerson (4%), Euthynnus affinis (3%), and Prionace glauca (3%) (Figure 4C, Table 19). ‘Other’ taxa, including other tunas, billfishes, sharks, and seerfishes, make up the remaining 14% of the total reconstructed catches (Figure 4C). The most abundant taxa caught between 1950 and the mid-1980s were Thunnus albacares and Thunnus maccoyii, followed by Carcharhinus falciformis and ‘other taxa’ (Figure 4C). The catches of Scomberomorus commerson increased over time, reaching a record high of 75,000 t in 2016 before slightly decreasing to ~65,000 t in 2020 (Figure 4C). Katsuwonus pelamis, Thunnus albacares, other taxa, and Thunnus tonggol made up the majority of catches in 2020 (~75) (Figure 4C). Tunas represented the most important species group across all gear and country groups (Table S20). The second most important species group for longline and purse seine fisheries were sharks (e.g., Carcharhinus falciformis, Prionace glauca) which represented nearly 13% and 7% of the total reconstructed catch, respectively, whereas the second most important species group targeted by the gillnet fisheries includes small tunas and mackerels (e.g., Thunnus tonggol, Scomberomorus commerson, Euthynnus affinis), representing 21% of the total reconstructed catch (Tables S20, S21). Pole-and-line and other gears focused their efforts primarily on catching principal target tunas followed by ‘other’ taxa, accounting for 5% and 44% of the total reconstructed catches (Tables S20, S21). Sharks (i.e., Carcharhinuns falciformis, Prionace glauca) were among the main species groups targeted by distant-water and Indian Ocean rim countries, with these two shark species alone accounting for nearly 7% and 19% of the total reconstructed catches, respectively (Tables S20, S22). Indian Ocean rim countries further targeted seerfishes and thunnini (e.g., Scomberomorus commerson, Euthynnus affinis, Thunnus tonggol), which accounted for nearly 9% of the total reconstructed catches (Tables S20, S22). The industrial fisheries for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean have been dominated by vessels flying the flags of Indian Ocean rim countries in recent decades, accounting for around 73% (~1 million t) of total catches in 2020 (Figure 5A, Table S23). Seventeen Indian Ocean rim countries are actively engaged in the industrial fisheries for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean (Table S25). The top ten Indian Ocean rim countries account for 70% of total reconstructed industrial catches of large pelagics in the Indian Ocean, and ~98% of the entire Indian Ocean rim country catches in 2020 (Figure 5A, Tables S24, S25). Indian Ocean rim country industrial catches of large pelagic species increased from 44,000 t·year-1 during the 1950s to slightly over 1 million t·year-1 by 2020 (Figure 5A, Table S23). Historically, however, catches by fleets flying the flag of 24 distant-water fishing countries dominated the fisheries for large pelagic species in this ocean basin (Figure 5A, Table S23), accounting for over 50% (~120,500 t·year-1) of total catches in the 1950s (Figure 5A). Total foreign catches increased from around 56,000 t·year-1 in the early 1950s to a peak of 716,000 t in 2005 (42% of total catches) before decreasing to 392,000 t·year-1 by 2020, at which point the distant-water fishing fleet catches accounted for only around 27% of total catches (Figure 5A). Figure 5 Total reconstructed industrial large pelagic fisheries catches for the Indian Ocean by (A) major country group from 1950 to 2020; (B) by analytically identified period (1950 – 1982, 1983 – 1999, and 2000-2020) and reporting status, where the pie chart size indicates the average amount of reported landings, unreported landings, and unreported discards per period; and (C) Composition of reconstructed total catches for the large pelagic fisheries catches for the Indian Ocean for 1950-2020 by country. The categories ‘other IOR’ and ‘other DWF’ consist of 14 and 21 additional countries with minor contributions to the overall catch. Unreported landings, as well as unreported discards, were dominated by distant-water fishing countries in the earliest period, accounting for 68% (~57,400 t·year-1) and 69% (~26,300 t·year-1) of unreported industrial landings and discards, respectively (Figure 5B). In the most recent period (2000-2020), they declined to 31% (~50,200 t·year-1) and 17% (~ 23,600 t·year-1, Figure 5B, Table S20). On the other hand, Indian Ocean rim countries accounted for much smaller shares of unreported industrial landings and discards in the early period from the 1950s to the early 1980s (Figure 5B). However, in most recent years, they far exceeded distant-water fishing countries with 69% of unreported industrial landings (110,700 t·year-1) and 83% of discards (112,400 t·year-1), respectively (Figure 5B, Table S24). During the earlier decades until the 1980s, approximately 90% (133,000 t·year-1) of the total reconstructed catches by distant-water countries was taken by Japan, followed by Taiwan, which contributed about 4% (~25,000 t·year-1) (Figure 5C, Table S25). Japan’s involvement in Indian Ocean tuna fisheries has declined substantially since the 1980s. More recently, Spain, Taiwan, and France dominate the distant-water fishing catches, accounting for 40% (~155,000 t·year-1), 26% (~103,000 t·year-1), and 15% (~59,000 t·year-1) of the total reconstructed distant-water catches in 2020, respectively (Figure 5C, Table S25). Historically, the Indian Ocean rim countries Pakistan and Indonesia dominated the total reconstructed Indian Ocean rim country catches, accounting for approximately 35% (~35,000 t·year-1) and 13% (~28,000 t·year-1) of Indian Ocean rim country catches in this industrial fishery during the 1950s-1980s, respectively (Figure 5C, Table S25). Other Indian Ocean rim country, such as the Maldives, Iran, and Oman, have considerably increased their industrial tuna fishing activities from the 1980s onwards (Table S25). As a result, Indonesia and the Maldives are among the most important countries involved in the fisheries for large pelagics, accounting for approximately 17% (~169,000 t·year-1) and 15% (~156,000 t·year-1) of the Indian Ocean rim country industrial catches in 2020, respectively (Figure 5C, Tables S24, S25). However, the most important Indian Ocean rim country in the industrial tuna fisheries since the early 2000s is Iran, whose catches steadily increased since the 1950s, now representing around 28% (~287,000 t·year-1) of the total reconstructed Indian Ocean rim country industrial catch of large pelagics in 2020 (Figure 5C). Underreporting of fisheries catches by at least 30-50% is widespread in global fisheries (Pauly and Zeller, 2016a), and the industrial fisheries for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean are no exception. We showed that these fisheries have underreported catches by nearly 30% since 1950 and at least 25% in recent years. As documented in this study, incomplete catch time series, non-reporting or underreporting of vulnerable bycatch species such as sharks, and the lack of discard records in the officially reported data are the primary cause of underreporting in these industrial Indian Ocean fisheries. This data shortfall suggests that despite the efforts of the IOTC to update, correct, and improve the catch data submitted by member countries, these data are still inconsistent and incomplete within and between countries and over time. The high proportion of unreported catches identified for the Indian Ocean’s large pelagic fisheries is concerning, given that the Indian Ocean tuna fishery is the second largest tuna fishery in the world, with ever-increasing catch volumes and highly industrialized vessels that heavily exploit both tunas and vulnerable bycatch species (Lecomte et al., 2017). The forty-fold increase in industrial Indian Ocean large pelagic catches, from approximately 35,000 t·year-1 in 1950 to just under 1.4 million t·year-1 by 2020, demonstrates the economic relevance of tuna fisheries in this ocean basin, a fishery that focuses mainly on supplying the global high-value seafood markets rather than local food security. It also illustrates the need for the IOTC to provide reliable and comprehensive catch data for the sustainable management of all species caught in these fisheries. Discarding in fisheries is a wasteful practice, yet there has been considerable uncertainty over the magnitude of discards for the fisheries for large pelagics in the Indian Ocean and how they have changed over time (Baum and Worm, 2009). Our results suggest that discards in these Indian Ocean fisheries constitute a substantial component of unreported catches, accounting for half of the total unreported catches in 2020. Furthermore, discarding was primarily attributable to the extensive and wasteful disposal practices associated with longline and gillnet vessels. This number is particularly alarming, as longline and gillnet gears are lethal to a broad array of animals, such as critically endangered sharks whose bycatch mortality is exceptionally high during longlining (Campana et al., 2009; Gilman, 2011; Godin et al., 2012). Further, a study in 2020 found that most of the world’s cetacean bycatch comes from entanglement in gillnets (Anderson et al., 2011; Anderson et al., 2020). Our results indicate an average discard rate of ~11% over the 1950 -2020 period, which coincides with estimates from Kelleher (2005); Gilman et al. (2017; 2020), and Pérez-Roda et al. (2019), who estimated between 5% and 14% of discards for global fisheries. We found that discard rates were consistently highest for longline and gillnet gears, at ~14% and ~11%, respectively, whereas purse seine discard rates were much lower at ~4%. Discards estimated for the pelagic fisheries in this ocean basin align well with discards previously estimated for the largest pelagic fisheries in the world in the Pacific Ocean, which were also estimated at ~11% per year on average during 1950-2010 (Schiller, 2014). Our study provides a more in-depth update on the previous preliminary estimation of discards in the Indian Ocean’s large pelagic fisheries by Coulter et al. (2020), which assumed a median of ~7% discards. The robustness of the underlying data for the present discard estimation remains relatively low due to extremely low and insufficient levels of observer coverage (~5%) and the low public availability of discard data (IOTC, 2011a). We emphasize that discard estimates provided by member countries to the IOTC should be included in the official IOTC reported baseline data as comprehensively raised and reconstructed discard estimates with comprehensive country, gear, and taxonomic compositions. Furthermore, the IOTC needs to substantially increase the observer coverage, either by human observers or via electronic monitoring systems on vessels active in the fisheries for large pelagic species, to ensure accurate catch and discard estimates (Gilman et al., 2019; van Helmond et al., 2020). However, this is only possible with increased compliance from member countries or through strengthening enforcement capacities within the IOTC. Since 2011, IOTC measures stipulate that all member countries shall collect verified catch and other scientific data related to the fisheries for large pelagic species, including landings and discards of vulnerable bycatch species through the Regional Observer Scheme (ROS) (IOTC, 2011b). However, most member countries continue to ignore these reporting requirements, and as a result, both retained, and discarded catches are still only partially reported to the Commission (IOTC, 2011b; Heidrich et al., 2022). The exclusion of discards from national and international data reporting systems is unfortunately common globally and is highly problematic given the increased focus on ecosystem-based fisheries management (Pauly and Zeller, 2016a; Zeller et al., 2018). Catches reported to the IOTC, and most other tuna RFMOs, are still accepted as ‘true’ in the absence of definitive proof to the contrary. The IOTC, however, acknowledges that these data are estimated with some level of uncertainty (IOTC, 2021a). The unreported landings and discards estimated here represent nearly 25% of the entire reconstructed catch in 2020 and have the potential to remain at this level unless more stringent measures are implemented to reduce non-reporting. Currently, these unreported catches may reflect the absence of sufficient and independent monitoring of vessels (Ewell et al., 2020). Furthermore, illegal fishing for tuna and sharks is known to occur throughout the Indian Ocean, with large-scale driftnets operating in the High Seas (Aranda et al., 2012; IOTC, 2012) and E.U. purse seiners likely accessing the EEZ waters of coastal countries illegally (Rattle, 2020). Our research found that longline and gillnet vessels contributed the majority (85%) of unreported catches of industrial tuna fisheries in the Indian Ocean. To what extent these catches are associated with illegal activities, such as using prohibited gear or fishing in EEZ waters without explicit access agreements, is currently not sufficiently known. We emphasize the need to address the underreporting of landings and discards seriously and to improve the IOTC catch statistics to strengthen the assessment and management of large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean. Our reconstruction suggested that reporting quality has improved for tunas, whereas shark catches still often remain un- or under-reported, particularly in recent decades. Sharks account for 21% of total unreported landings and discards in 2020. There is a strong incentive to underreport shark catches when restrictive quotas are in place (Copes, 1986). The imposition of several fishing limits and restrictions on the trade of vulnerable sharks and rays, i.e., thresher sharks (Alopidae), oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus), and mobulid rays (Mobula spp.), including a ban on the retention, finning, and trading of specific species was a necessary first step towards the conservation of pelagic shark species (IOTC, 2010; IOTC, 2012; IOTC, 2013; IOTC, 2019b; IOTC, 2019c). Sharks are particularly vulnerable to fishing pressures due to their life history characteristics such as late maturity, low reproductive rates, and slow population growth (Hoenig, 1990). The failure of countries to collect and report detailed fisheries data on sharks hampers accurate population assessments that can inform management advice (Chen et al., 2003; Clarke et al., 2006; Cavanagh et al., 2009; Abella, 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). The majority of shark catch data reported by the IOTC on behalf of its member countries, particularly in earlier years, consists of highly aggregated taxonomic groups, i.e., ‘sharks various nei’. The uninformative coarse taxonomic resolution may be an artifact of the challenges associated with identifying sharks to the species level in field conditions. Reporting catches at fine taxonomic resolution requires a certain level of expertise and experience, but the misidentification of shark species is common, not least due to the lack of trained observers (IOTC, 2021b). The proportion of catches reported by species has increased in recent years, yet, some fleets continue only to report catches for species identified explicitly by the Commission and do not report catches of other species, causing difficulties in estimating total catches of all sharks and in disaggregating catches into species groups at a later date (IOTC, 2021b). This substantial taxonomic aggregation in the data reported by the IOTC on behalf of its member countries may mask essential patterns and trends in the Indian Ocean fisheries for large pelagics and further complicate the sustainable management of those species in the Indian Ocean. The industrial fisheries for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean have already led to clearly identified impacts on shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrhynchus) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) (Murua et al., 2009). Our study demonstrated that distant-water fishing countries from East Asia and Europe historically dominated large-scale industrial fishing for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean. These large fleets, flagged to distant-water countries outside the Indian Ocean region, were gradually replaced by fleets increasingly flagged to Indian Ocean rim countries, which currently account for the majority of industrial pelagic catches taken in the Indian Ocean (Lecomte et al., 2017). This shift in fishing country flags coincided with the intensification of reflagging and flag-hopping, as well as the growing use of flags of convenience and vessel chartering by coastal Indian Ocean countries starting in the 1990s (Majkowski, 2007). The use of flags of convenience and charters, where the majority beneficial ownership of vessels continues to lie outside the Indian Ocean rim country flag/host state, is unfortunately common practice in large-scale commercial fisheries today (Ford et al., 2022). However, this ability to register vessels in a country where the vessel or business owner is not a citizen or permanent resident and where its society does not receive the overwhelming majority of socio-economic benefits creates immense regulatory and tax challenges and contributes to the corruption in the fisheries sector tied to Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing (C4ADS and Trygg Mat, 2020). The most prominent example of this growing link between reflagged vessels and high-risk fishing practices is the exploitation of West African flags, mainly by Asian, especially Chinese vessels and fishing captains (Belhabib et al., 2015), to evade effective control and fish unsustainably and irresponsibly in both sovereign African and international waters (SRFC, 2013M; Belhabib, 2017; Belhabib et al., 2020). There are also examples of known IUU fishing activities in the Indian Ocean, such as unauthorized tuna longlining and transshipment in the Bay of Bengal, a hotspot for IUU fishing (Faiyaz and Al Arif, 2022) and likely non-compliance with national and international regulations by Spanish-owned vessels fishing in Indian and Somali waters without authorization (Rattle, 2020; Rattle and Duncan-Jones, 2022; Richardson, 2022). The IOTC and other regional regulatory bodies in the Indian Ocean urgently need to address IUU fishing and the problem of reflagging foreign vessels in the region. Many of the Indian Ocean rim countries engaged in fisheries for large pelagics continue to have poor monitoring systems, thus introducing high uncertainty in the region’s total catches by species, areas, and gears (Aranda et al., 2012). These vessels, classified by the IOTC as artisanal vessels engaged in small-scale fishing operations in the coastal waters of Indian Ocean rim countries, have increasingly gained navigational autonomy and onboard catch preservation capacities to undertake longer voyages beyond coastal and national waters, now competing with large-scale distant-water fleets in the High Seas (Aranda et al., 2012). This also supports our decision in this study to reclassify ~25% of catches reported by the IOTC as ‘artisanal’ to the industrial fishing sector. We commend the efforts of the IOTC on their in-country ‘fact-finding’ missions to enhance the understanding of data collection processes but emphasize the need to further improve awareness of the range of artisanal and industrial data collection systems in place to better understand the accuracy of current catch statistics (OFC, 2007; OFC, 2010; OFC, 2013). Our study is the first to comprehensively account for all sources of total fisheries catches for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean, including major unreported landings and discards. However, numerous challenges were uncovered with regard to both the quantity and quality of available data and information and the accuracy of these sources. Furthermore, our results likely do not adequately reflect changes in the taxonomic composition of discards that may have occurred in earlier decades, as most of the taxonomic information on discards used for the reconstruction was based on data from recent decades. We recognize that our reconstructed estimates of unreported catch components are likely subject to higher uncertainty than the officially reported catch data (Zeller and Pauly, 2018; Zeller et al., 2023b). Yet, we believe that the reconstructed unreported catch components are the best current estimates and may likely even be conservative. Comprehensive and more accurate time series of catches can better inform effective management advice for large pelagic species. Inaccurate and incomplete catch statistics, including the lack of taxonomic resolution, are a ubiquitous challenge and are recognized as a major obstacle to fisheries research and management (Ferretti et al., 2008; Bradai et al., 2012). Total allowable catches (TACs), which are partially informed by historical catch time series, can have substantial influence on rebuilding overfished stocks (Pons et al., 2017). Accordingly, well-informed TACs should be considered a primary tool for preventing the overexploitation of large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean, yet scientists and managers in the IOTC still debate the level of quotas set (Seto et al., 2020). We have provided a more comprehensive and transparent accounting of the industrial fisheries catches for large pelagic species in the Indian Ocean between 1950 and 2020 and highlighted the need for substantially improved accounting of catches in national and international statistics. Specifically, catch underreporting and high uncertainties in catches reported to the IOTC remain a challenge for Indian Ocean rim countries, despite improvements in the IOTC data reporting systems in recent years (IOTC, 2021b). Reconstructed catches in the Indian Ocean were 30% higher than the data reported by the IOTC on behalf of its member countries, potentially questioning the reliability of any TACs derived from incomplete data. Furthermore, additional monitoring and enforcement efforts are needed to improve fisheries in both the coastal and High Seas waters to counteract the unknown contribution to the exploitation of large pelagics in the Indian Ocean. We recommend that the IOTC and other regional regulatory bodies in the Indian Ocean urgently address IUU fishing and the problem of reflagging foreign vessels in the region. We also recommend they adopt harmonized and real-time traceability tools, such as permanent, compulsory AIS, and electronic catch documentation schemes for all industrial fleets, and gears. Furthermore, we urge a substantial increase in independent observer program coverage in all industrial fleet segments, by taking full advantage of all electronic and video monitoring technology.

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Bing,North Carolina fishing team wins $1.7M after catching 504-pound blue marlin," 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 A fishing crew recently caught a prize-worthy marlin at the 66th Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament in North Carolina. The team aboard the Hatteras-based boat, “Release,” reeled in a blue marlin weighing 504 pounds, earning the group of men $1.7 million. The captain of the 53-foot Bobby Sullivan vessel, Rom Whitaker, led the team to success with Angler Kirk Pugh pulling in the striking big blue fish. “These guys have been fishing together in this tournament for 22 years and have never boated a marlin in this tournament before,” a North Carolina resident who is close to the anglers told Fox News Digital (the resident requested her name be omitted for privacy reasons). Blue Marlins are native to the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. These fish tend to be in the average range of 11 feet and 200 to 400 pounds, according to National Geographic.  The tournament set sail with a record-breaking number of 302 fishing boats on Monday. “Captain Rom’s win in the Fab Fish Level and Game Time’s leaderboard shakeup yesterday afternoon created the perfect start to the week,” Big Rock Blue Marlin Tournament Executive Director, Madison Struyk, told Fox News Digital. She said Big Rock is the largest non-profit billfish tournament in the world. “The Big Rock Foundation is the charitable arm of the tournament and has donated over $10 million to worthy organizations since 1986. For the past 3 years, the Big Rock Foundation has made annual contributions over a million dollars,” Struyk said. The fishing tournament is set to continue until Sunday. Fox News Digital reached out to Captain Rom Whitaker and Kirk Pugh, who is one of the anglers, for comment.  Advertisement",7 days ago

			 NOAA Fisheries is providing $6 million in Inflation Reduction Act funding to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The funding will support projects developing technologies to minimize risk from vessel strikes—a primary threat to endangered North Atlantic right whales and other large whales. The partnership will facilitate innovative, technology-based tools, and increase the use and awareness of existing technologies to reduce vessel strikes to the North Atlantic right whale. These could include tools that detect and identify whales and alert vessels when a whale is present and recommend actions.

Impact of climate on fish stocks If “overfishing” of a fish stock continues unchecked with no strategies to rebuild it will become “overfished” with a population size that is too low and jeopardizes the stock’s ability to produce a sustainable yield. Today, prevailing environmental and fishery conditions are changing exponentially due to climate impacts. From warming waters to acidification, the climate crisis is fundamentally changing the ocean; these changes are jeopardizing the ability of fish to grow and thrive, in turn reducing fisheries’ productivity. Earlier this month, NOAA Fisheries released a 2023 Stock Status Report which can be the found on their website at https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/status-stocks-2023. Although some of the news in the report is encouraging, much more needs to be done.  The overfishing status is only known for 72% of stocks and the overfished status for 52%. That means hundreds of fish stocks have an unknown status. We need to improve data collection of unknown stocks so NOAA Fisheries can do their job. According to the 2023 Stock Status Report nearly a fifth of stocks remain overfished.  The good news is that the number of overfished stocks decreased: 47 fish stocks, or 18% of all known U.S. stocks, are considered overfished. Some of our most iconic stocks, including Atlantic cod, have remained on the overfished list for years. Despite recent fisheries progress the U.S. still isn’t doing enough to keep up with climate change. For more on this perspective visit www.fisheriesforward.org/status-of-stocks/. Where’s the bite? Freshwater fishing Striped bass and bluefish. Elisa Cahill of Snug Harbor Marina, South Kingstown, said, “The southeast and southwest sides of Block Island were on fire over the holiday with anglers catching striped bass using topwater lures. The fish were slot size (28 to < 31 inches) and above. Our salt ponds are good too we worm hatches still occurring.” Cape Cod Canal fishing expert and author East End Eddie Doherty, said, “The full moon Thursday morning, ushered in some breaking tides have been more pronounced and powerful in the east end. Some nice bass were caught by Joe Gray of Sagamore Beach on his Ditch Witch and Taylor Point’s ‘Breakin Bob’ Weir with a white spook during a mid-Canal surface bite. Worcester Firefighter Joel Benoit fooled some slots and Buzzards Bay’s Ben Sivonen lost count after reeling in over 10 fish with the biggest measuring 45 inches. I was jigging a 5-ounce white Hurley Canal Killer in the east tide next to Vietnam Veteran Steve Colleran when fish started breaking in front of us like a happy dream.”  Anglers Shaina Boyle and her father Gary Vandemoortele caught five striped bass to 28-inch and bluefish to 30 inches in Greenwich Bay last Wednesday. This weekend I fished in the same area with a friend and hooked up with a keeper and two smaller fish. All these fish were caught in 7 to 12 feet of water trolling tube & worm at the bottom. No fish were found in the East Passage at Poppasquash Point, Bristol nor at Warwick Neck. Declan O’Donnell of Breachway Bait & Tackle, Charlestown, said, “The bait is getting pushed into the ponds on an incoming tide with small spooks, and small soft plastics working in the salt pond channels. Back in the pond the worm hatch is still on, and  out front bass and blues are being found on rockpiles and Breachway outflows eating anything from top water to live eels. Won’t be long before some of the 30-40-pound bass start staging on our local reefs.” Tautog. The spring tautog season ends on May 31 in Rhode Island for the spawning season and will reopen August 1. In Massachusetts, the catch limit drops to one fish/person/day from June 1 to July 31. In both states the open season limit changes on Aug. 1 with a three fish/person/day limit, 16 to 21-inch slot with one fish allowed to be over 21 inches. “Summer Flounder (fluke), black sea bass and squid. “Fluke reports are starting to pick up with mostly smaller fish being caught locally and a few bigger fish being caught at the island. Black Sea Bass are still out in deeper water but are slowly making their way in. There is an abundance of squid out-front,” said O’Donnell of Breachway Bait & Tackle. We weighed in an 11-pound fluke over the holiday caught along the southern coastal beaches. Anglers are having some difficulty finding flukes but when they do they tend to be large.  Anglers are also targeting fluke at the East Grounds and in the Block Island Wind Farm area with good results,” said Elisa Cahill of Snug Harbor. “Squid fishing remains strong along the coastal beaches,” said Cahill of Sung Harbor Dave Monti holds a master captain’s license and charter fishing license. He serves on a variety of boards and commissions and has a consulting business focusing on clean oceans, habitat preservation, conservation, renewable energy, and fisheries related issues and clients.

Vessel caught underreporting catch in North Atlantic,Bing,2 cargo ships caught fire after being hit by projectiles in suspected Houthi attacks off the coast of Yemen," Two cargo ships traveling off Yemen's southern port city of Aden caught fire after being hit by projectiles suspected to have been fired by Houthi rebels, UK maritime agencies reported. United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said on Sundayit had been informed of an incident 80 nautical miles southeast of Aden. UKMTO is linked to the UK's Royal Navy.  Suspicion for the attack fell on Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have not claimed responsibility for the latest attack but have been targeting shipping in the area for several months with missiles and drones. The British security firm Ambrey later said a cargo vessel from Antigua and Barbuda had been hit by a missile 83 nautical miles southeast of Aden. The ship caught fire but it was contained. ""The ship was heading southwest along the Gulf of Aden at a speed of 8.2 knots when a missile struck the forward station. A fire started but was neutralized,"" Ambrey said in an advisory note seen by Reuters. ""A second missile was sighted but did not hit the ship. Persons on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident,"" Ambrey said. No injuries were reported after the ship diverted and sped up. The UKMTO said they had received a second report about another incident 70 nautical miles southwest of Aden. ""The master reports that the vessel was hit by an unknown projectile on the aft section, which resulted in a fire. Damage control is underway,"" UKMTO said. No casualties were reported and the UKMTO said the vessel was ""proceeding to its next port of call. Authorities continue to monitor the situation."" Reuters reported on Friday that the Houthi rebels had claimed responsibility for attacks on two merchant ships in the Red Sea with ""a number of drones and ballistic and naval missiles,"" but there was no independent confirmation of the incidents. Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea corridor and the Gulf of Aden with missiles and drones as part of a campaign that aims to put pressure on Israel and the West over the war in Gaza. Shipping vessels have been forced to take longer and more costly routes around the south of Africa. A US Navy carrier strike group and warships from European nations have defended the key shipping lanes. On Monday, the Houthi rebels said they had fired a new solid-fuel missile called the ""Palestine"" at the southern Israeli city of Eilat on Monday. The rebels have also detained 11 Yemeni employees of UN agencies under uncertain circumstances, it was reported on Friday. ""We are very concerned about these developments, and we're actively seeking clarification from the Houthi de facto authorities regarding the circumstances of these detentions,"" UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in New York. Of the 11, the UN said six had been working for the UN's human rights agency, and the rest all worked separately for its special envoy's office, its development arm, Unicef, the World Food Program, and Unesco. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the US was planned to further increase economic pressure on the Houthis by blocking their revenue sources. This includes preventing a $1.5 billion Saudi payment to cover salaries for government employees in militia-held territory. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

Vessel caught misreporting haddock catch,Google,Electronic monitoring long-awaited boon for Cape fishermen," CHATHAM — More than a decade of advocacy by local fishermen finally paid off when the New England Fishery Management Council at its meeting last month approved the use of video cameras on fishing vessels to monitor catches. Electronic monitoring is a critical part of the council plan known as Amendment 23 that passed Sept. 30 and set a target of covering 100% of all fishing trips to catch bottom-feeding species such as cod, haddock and flounders that are collectively known as groundfish. “The Council has known for quite a while now that we needed to improve the groundfish monitoring program,” council spokesperson Janice Plante said. “We’d had some issues in the past with unreported or misreported catches. We know there’s an incentive to illegally discard certain stocks, especially those with low catch limits.” Plus, just 31% of groundfish trips were required to be covered by human observers riding on fishing vessels tracking the number of discarded and caught fish and Plante said the council knew that sometimes fishermen fished differently on observed trips and unobserved trips. “These are all things the Council wanted to address by improving the catch monitoring program,” Plante wrote in an email. Cape fishermen first started advocating for the use of electronic monitoring in 2006, said Melissa Sanderson, chief operating officer of the Cape Cod Commercial Fishermen’s Alliance. “I would say it’s a long time coming,” said Sanderson of the 14 years it took to finally have approval. Most of the delay was in ironing out details with the National Marine Fisheries Service. “Most fishermen were done with it,” Sanderson said when the agency did not support switching from human observers to cameras after Cape fishermen ran a pilot project for a few years. But six years ago, Maine fishermen revived interest with their own pilot program and Cape fishermen joined the following year using equipment and technical support provided by The Nature Conservancy and grants from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. “Since achieving 100% monitoring will require additional funding, the Conservancy has set aside $2 million to purchase and install EM systems for any fishermen interested in using a safer and more cost-effective tool to meet these new monitoring requirements,"" said Chris McGuire, marine program director at the Nature Conservancy. Barnstable fisherman Eric Hesse said he’s had four cameras on board his long-line vessel for at least the last three years. “This has been around for decades on the West Coast. “We need more accountability in our fishery and this is one of the tools.” Most groundfish fishermen belong to sectors, groups of fishermen who collectively manage the quota assigned to them with a mandate of not overfishing any species and minimizing discards of species they aren’t targeting or don’t have the quota to catch. Sector fishermen are required to carry what are known as at-sea monitors, human observers who document catches and discards as a way to show they are adhering to their agreement with NMFS. Electronic monitoring is an option fishermen can choose to avoid the expense of having to pay for human observers, something that has rankled fishermen in recent years as their catches declined. Plus COVID-19 heightened concerns about having strangers onboard. Vessels may still be required to occasionally carry a federal observer who collects science-based information. Sanderson explained that the fisherman turns on the cameras when leaving on a groundfish trip or a fishing trip for other species that require observers. Either three or four cameras record the net or fishing line coming up out of the water, and the discarded fish being measured and thrown back. A wide angle view records activity on the deck. Sanderson said her organization and others worked with fishermen to reduce the burden of measuring each discard by showing that a sample size could stand in for the whole when volumes increased. The fisherman/captain removes the hard drive from the video system once the boat docks and submits it to a contractor who audits a portion of the video and reports to NMFS. Sanderson, who has worked on the electronic monitoring program since 2010, said there are 23 vessels participating in the pilot program now with another eight waiting for equipment. Amendment 23 allowed fishermen to choose between continuing to use human observers on groundfish trips or one of two electronic monitoring programs. Most fishermen thus far have chosen the alternative that allows them to discard fish as long as their recording includes measurement of a representative sample from each species of discards. The other requires fishermen to separate discards and market fish, but keep them all onboard until they return to dock to have them verified by a dockside monitor. NMFS said they believe they have enough money to pay for the 2021 at-sea monitor coverage, both human and electronic. The New England council set a minimum at-sea monitor coverage rate of 40%, which would be industry-funded if NMFS has no money to pay for them. They said they would like to see 100% if NMFS has the funds. Amendment 23 still has to be translated into a proposed rule by NMFS and go through a comment period and published as a final rule before the beginning of the May 1, 2021, fishing season.

                 National Statistics publication that provides data on weight and value of sea fish and shellfish landed by fishing vessels,  structure of the Scottish fishing fleet and employment on Scottish vessels. The supporting documents include accessible tables and a pdf version of the publication. In 2021, Scottish vessels landed 437 thousand tonnes of sea fish and shellfish with a gross value of £560 million (Table 8). Compared to 2020 there was an increase of 15 per cent in the real value of landings and a 10 per cent increase in the tonnage landed. The increase in real value was driven by shellfish and pelagic species, as demersal species decreased in value. Shellfish landed by Scottish vessels and included in this publication are crustaceans, molluscs and cephalopods. This includes species such lobsters and crabs, which are commonly eaten in restaurants. Therefore, hospitality closures due to Covid-19 resulting in a loss of trade and markets particularly affected the shellfish sector in 2020. Markets at home and abroad collapsed as a result of hospitality closures. Despite positive signs, recovery is still ongoing as some restrictions were still in place in 2021, particularly in the hospitality sector. The closure of the restaurant and hospitality sector in the UK and abroad during periods of 2020 and 2021 also impacted the demersal sector. Demersal fish are those which live close to the seabed such as cod, haddock and monkfish. Reduction of quota allocation to Scotland for species such as cod has also negatively impacted the demersal sector. The pelagic sector are species found mainly in shoals in midwater or near the surface of the sea such as herring and mackerel. This sector is seasonal and generally operates with larger vessels. It was largely unaffected by the impacts of Covid-19 and increased in tonnage and value in 2020 and again in 2021. Scotland’s commercial fishing industry comprises a significant proportion of the United Kingdom fishing industry. Landings by Scottish vessels accounted for 61 per cent of the value and 67 per cent of the tonnage of all landings by UK vessels in 2021 (Table 25a). Data source: Table 3. As can be seen in Chart 1, the long term trend for the value of the fish landed by Scottish vessels has been generally stable since 2016, with 2020 being an exception due to the impacts of Covid-19. The 15 per cent increase in the real terms value of landings by Scottish vessels, to £560 million between 2020 and 2021, was driven by an increase in the value of shellfish and pelagic species. The real terms value of shellfish landings increased by 29 per cent and pelagic landings increased by 18 per cent compared to 2020, whereas demersal landings decreased by one per cent.  The 10 per cent increase in tonnage landed by Scottish vessels is attributed to an increase in landings of shellfish and pelagic fish. Shellfish landings rose 18 per cent by tonnage and pelagic landings rose 14 per cent. Demersal landings decreased by 10 per cent. Mackerel remained the most valuable species with £210 million landed, accounting for 37 per cent of the total value of Scottish landings. In 2021, the real value of mackerel landings increased by 16 per cent and tonnage increased by eight per cent. This increase is in line with an increase in available quota. Quota is the share of the fish catch allowed to vessels. Scottish vessels’ landings accounted for just over four fifths (82 per cent) of UK mackerel landings by tonnage and 86 per cent by value. Scottish vessels commonly catch a wide variety of demersal species, including more than a dozen species with landings that are worth £1 million or more annually (Table 8). Monkfish became the most valuable demersal species and represented six per cent of the total value of Scottish vessels’ landings and 23 per cent of the value of demersal landings in 2021. Nephrops are the most valuable shellfish stock and the only shellfish species currently subject to quota. Scottish vessels fish for Nephrops by creeling and by trawling. Creeled Nephrops are often caught and exported live. Creeled Nephrops represent a smaller tonnage of landings, but attract an average price per tonne four times that of trawled Nephrops. Some trawled Nephrops are sold whole but the majority are sold as tails for turning into scampi. In 2021, 1,423 tonnes of creeled Nephrops were landed by Scottish vessels with a value of £15 million[6]. Twenty-one thousand tonnes of trawled Nephrops were landed worth £55 million. These data are presented in Table 30c. Data source: Table 8. Data source: Table 8. Over the past ten years 2012-2021, the tonnage of pelagic landings has increased by 51 per cent with real terms value increasing by 31 per cent. Compared to 2012, the tonnage of demersal landings fell by 19 per cent with real terms value decreasing by 13 per cent. Over the period 2012 to 2021, shellfish landings and real terms value have both fallen by 17 per cent. The decreases for shellfish and demersal are unlikely to be a long-term decrease and more a reflection of the decrease in 2020 and 2021 (compared to 2019) due to the impact of Covid-19. Data source: Table 3. Data source: Table 3. Scottish vessels land a vast range of different species throughout the year and they all achieve different prices at auction. The price achieved will vary by species, individual market, supply, demand, seasonality and the condition of the fish. Table 2 shows the average price per tonne for a selection of species landed by Scottish vessels.  It is clear that there is great variation in the prices achieved across the different species. Mackerel is the highest value species for Scottish vessels yet has a much lower price per tonne than many other species. It is the vast tonnage of mackerel caught that leads to the value being so high.  Lobsters have the highest price per tonne yet a fairly low value compared to other main species. This is due to seasonality, lobster is not in season during several months of the year resulting in a lower tonnage landed throughout the year compared to other species. They are also considered a luxury food and tend to be purchased mainly by the hospitality sector. Total Allowable Catches (TAC) are limits set at annual international negotiations for individual fish stocks and represent the maximum of each fish stock that can be caught. Up until 2020, while the UK was still a member of the European Union (EU) the majority of stocks were managed and fished only by EU member states. Member states access to management and fishing of stocks were based on a number of factors, including historic track record. The TACs for these stocks were set by the European Commission through internal negotiations between EU member states with an interest and based on independent scientific advice from ICES. The remaining stocks were managed and shared with other Coastal States: Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Russia, with TACs for these set at separate negotiations. The amounts corresponding to this share, known as quotas, are shown at the UK and at the Scottish Producers Organisations’ (POs) level in tables 36a to 36d.  Uptake of key commercial quota stocks by all Scottish vessels by tonnage and value landed are presented in table 37. In general, Scottish POs had high quota uptake in 2021 for key demersal and pelagic species. Uptake of mackerel stocks in the North Sea was above 90 per cent and uptake of mackerel stocks in the West of Scotland exceeded quota[10]. For demersal stocks, uptake in the North Sea was generally high with cod quota uptake at 99 per cent and monkfish at 91 per cent. West of Scotland cod has a nil quota and is managed as a bycatch. The Scottish quota reduction for cod of more than 66 per cent between 2019 and 2021 led to an increased pace of quota uptake, reflecting the importance of this species to the domestic fleet. The only shellfish species subject to quota is Nephrops. In 2021, Scottish PO quota uptake for North Sea Nephrops was 91 per cent and for West Coast Nephrops it was 65 per cent. This is 30 percentage points up compared to 2020 for the North Sea and 21 percentage points up for the West Coast. Scottish vessels land their catches into Scotland, the rest of the UK and several countries abroad. In 2021, Scottish vessels landed 170 thousand tonnes of sea fish and shellfish worth £148 million abroad. Data source: Table 4, Table 5, Table 8, Table 28. Landings abroad accounted for 39 per cent of all landings by Scottish vessels by tonnage and 26 per cent by value. Of this, 93 per cent of the tonnage landed abroad was pelagic. The main species landed abroad was mackerel, representing 77 per cent of the total value of fish landed abroad in 2021. There were 100 thousand tonnes of mackerel worth £114 million landed abroad, which is both 54 per cent of the total tonnage and value of mackerel landed by Scottish vessels. Norway is by far the largest destination for Scottish vessels’ landings abroad, accounting for 20 per cent by value of all Scottish vessels’ landings and 77 per cent by value of all landings abroad. In 2021, 89 per cent of the value of landings into Norway was for mackerel, amounting to 89 thousand tonnes with a value of £101 million. Scottish vessels are most active in two main ICES Rectangles[11] : the Northern North Sea (ICES Area IVa) and the West Coast of Scotland (ICES Area VIa).  In 2021, 212 thousand tonnes of sea fish and shellfish with a value of £306 million were landed from the Northern North Sea (IVa), representing 48 per cent of the tonnage and 55 per cent of the value of all landings by Scottish vessels (Table 31).  Over one third (34 per cent) of landings by Scottish vessels, by tonnage were caught in the West Coast of Scotland (VIa), providing 31 per cent of the total value of all Scottish landings.  Area VII accounted for nine per cent of the tonnage of all landings and five per cent of value.

Vessel caught misreporting haddock catch,Bing,Peruvian authorities implement “laughable” fine against Chinese IUU vessel," Search Share    A Chinese vessel caught illegally fishing in Peru’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) has only suffered a small punishment for its actions, with Peruvian authorities fining the infringing vessel PEN 242 (USD 65, EUR 60). The negligible sanction on the Tian Xiang vessel provoked the ire of Peru’s National Society of Artisanal Fishing (Sonapescal), which called the penalty “laughable” and said the fine does not repair the environmental damage caused by the vessel or discourage future vessels from fishing illegally. In 2023, more than 150 foreign vessels entered Peru’s EEZ without using the satellite devices required by Peruvian law for fishing activities; so far this year, the total has reached 35, according to Sonapescal. What makes the situation especially tough to swallow, according to the organization, is that Peruvian officials often charge heavy fines to small-scale fishers caught under the same circumstances. “[Authorities] impose exorbitant fines on artisanal fishermen, initiate criminal proceedings against us, freeze our bank accounts, and confiscate our boats and fishing equipment,” Sonapescal Vice President Edwin Houghton told La República. Peru’s Ministry of Production (PRODUCE), which oversees the country’s fishing activity, has acknowledged the country's fishing regulations need to be revised in order to deter illegal activity. According to Sonapescal, four more foreign ships were improperly authorized to enter Peruvian waters in May, despite not having the proper tracking devices as mandated by supreme decree 016-2016-PRODUCE. All four vessels – Ning Tai 11, Zhou Yu 908, Pu Yuan 827, and Hua Ying 78 – have a history of illegal activity and labor abuse, Sonapescal said. The association has asked the Ministry of Defense and PRODUCE to intensify inspections of foreign vessels entering Peru’s exclusive economic zone. South American countries have had issues with foreign fleets fishing illegally in their national waters for years. The U.S. has recently sought to aid South American governments with deterrence of illegal fishing in the region, which is estimated to cost them and South American companies billions of dollars in revenue annually.    Become a  Premium member to  unlock the rest of this article.

Vessel caught misreporting haddock catch,Bing,Sustainable Scotland: Future-proof fishing," Members of the Scottish Fisheries Sustainability Accreditation Group are managing whitefish stocks while protecting habitats and embracing new technology. By Rachel Leahy  Andrew Bremner skippers the vessel Boy Andrew in the cold deep waters off North Scotland where it catches whitefish such as haddock. Hailing from a fishing community that was rocked by the collapse of North Sea cod stocks in the early 1990s and
    2000s, Bremner knows better than most the importance of fishing sustainably. That event - which saw stocks fall from over 220,000 tonnes in the early 1970s to record lows of 32,000 tonnes in 2005 -
    still impacts Scottish fishers today. Vessels avoid catching cod to allow the stock to recover, and there is a determination to ensure fishers’ livelihoods and other species avoid the same fate as cod. 
                            SFSAG Northern Demersal Stocks
                         
                            Haddock, hake, plaice, saithe (coley, pollock) whiting
                         
                            Scottish seines and bottom trawls
                         “It’s in my interest to fish within sustainable levels,” says Bremner. “This has to do with the science. With haddock you are only taking out a safe level. You are not scratching the surface of what is there.” The fishery is better equipped to fish sustainably than ever before. It uses proactive management strategies to protect habitats and is embracing new technology - including an artificial intelligence powered robotic sorting system – to reduce impacts
    on the wider ocean ecosystem, minimise unwanted bycatch and ensure stocks are maintained at sustainable levels. “It’s your future you are working with and gambling with – why jeopardise it?” states Colin Stephen, skipper of the Harvest Hope, “You have to think about the long term.” Boy Andrew skipper, Andrew Bremner The haddock fleet is part of the Scottish Fisheries Sustainability Accreditatioon Group (SFSAG) Northern Demersal stocks fishery, which has been certified to the MSC Fisheries Standard for sustainable fishing since 2010. The fishery, which also targets MSC
    certified hake, plaice and saithe (coley), is one of the most valuable in Scotland with the haddock catch alone worth approximately £40 million every year. The fishers use trawl nets, which are pulled along or close to the seabed. To be certified as sustainable, the fishery managers must demonstrate that this gear does not cause serious damage or irreversible harm to habitats. Significant research has been carried out to identify seafloor habitats within the fishery and determine how they are impacted by fishing activity. When a habitat survey revealed colonies of tall seapens, in a region off northeast Scotland, the fishery
    voluntarily closed the area to fishing. Tall seapens are a type of coldwater coral which can grow up to two metres and support an important habitat for burrowing species such as langoustines. Tall seapens are particularly vulnerable to damage from fishing gear as, unlike other seapen species,
    they cannot retract into the seabed when disturbed. This measure was brought in with immediate effect and compliance continues to be closely monitored by Marine Scotland, which manages Scotland’s seas and freshwater fisheries.   Harvest Hope skipper, Colin Stephen While haddock stocks are healthy, there remains an urgent need for North Sea cod stocks to recover. However, shoals of cod often overlap with the haddock, hake, plaice and saithe targeted by the SFSAG fishers, which puts this vulnerable species at risk of being caught accidentally. “We [the fishermen] need to continue to recognise the important part we need to play in maintaining sustainable stocks and healthy oceans,” Park adds. “There’s no doubt that the most efficient way to protect the stocks is to avoid catching those you don’t want.” The fishery has worked hard to reduce cod bycatch, which was set as a condition of MSC certification in 2012. In collaboration with the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation Gear Innovation and Tech Advisory Group, the fishery trialled trawl net modifications to identify effective ways to prevent bycatch of cod and juvenile fish. The addition of a square mesh escape panel reduced cod bycatch by 60% and has been adopted by all vessels in the fishery that use nets with a mesh less than 120mm. Other measures to reduce cod bycatch include real-time area closures if high levels of juvenile cod are caught, and seasonal closures to protect cod while spawning. Haddock trawler on waves New technology is also empowering fishers to reduce the impacts of fishing. This includes systems that allow fishers to more closely monitor their catch and quickly share information with other vessels. Many vessels within the SFSAG fishery have started using BATmap, a new app developed by the Scottish Fisherman’s Organisation, the University of Aberdeen and Fisheries Innovation Scotland, among others. The app records bycatch species, quantity and location in real-time – if catch exceeds an agreed threshold, other vessels are automatically alerted so they can avoid fishing in the same area. Mike Park, Chairman Fishers Roberto Necesario and Henry Bello New AI technology to improve the selectivity of trawl nets is also being trialled in the fishery. Researchers at Heriot Watt University have developed the Smartrawl robotic sorting system which uses cameras and a gate system to identify the size and species of individuals that enter the net, and release those which should not be caught. These innovations, alongside the Scottish fishers’ longstanding commitment to sustainability, are playing a vital part to secure the future of the fishery.

Vessel caught misreporting haddock catch,Bing,"EU fishing fleets agree to cut catches of cod, haddock and sole"," MercoPress, en Español Get our news on your inbox!  Suscribe x MercoPress, en Español Montevideo, June 19th 2024  - 16:24 UTC     The EU says European fishing fleets will have to cut their catches of cod, haddock and sole next year, but a ban on anchovy fishing has been lifted. The quota for cod fishing is being cut by 15-35%, depending on the area. But there is an exemption for cod fishing in West Scotland and the Celtic Sea. There are increased quotas for some fish, including plaice - by up to 14% - and herring - by 72% in the Celtic Sea.  Anchovy fishing will resume in the Bay of Biscay. A ban was imposed in 2005.  That is seen as good news for French and Spanish trawlers.  But fishing for endangered porbeagle and spurdog sharks will be banned.  One innovation in the EU fisheries policy for 2010 is that crews will be entitled to a 5% larger catch if they install CCTV cameras on their vessels to monitor conservation measures.  The plan is for the cameras - three per vessel - to check on the size of catches and to ensure that crews do not illegally toss unwanted fish back into the sea - a wasteful practice known as “discards”.  Denmark has been urging the EU to adopt CCTV on board trawlers. It introduced such a pilot scheme in September 2008.  Conservationists have condemned discards, which arise because the quotas for fish delivered to port often do not match the volumes of fish actually caught.  Earlier this year the European Commission said more than 80% of Europe's fish stocks had been over-fished.  Commenting on the deal reached late on Tuesday, EU Fisheries Commissioner Joe Borg said he saw some signs that over-fishing was declining.  He said a “small but increasing” number of stocks were now being fished sustainably.  Final quotas for shared stocks with Norway and the Faroe Islands will not be set until negotiations in January.  Scottish Fisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead said that “given the challenging backdrop, these were always going to be tough talks.  ”The outcome will offer some degree of comfort to parts of our industry...  “We have achieved gains for some of our most valuable stocks and secured interim arrangements to ensure stocks shared with Norway can still be fished.”  A Scottish Conservative Euro MP, Struan Stevenson, however condemned the outcome, warning of “disaster” for some crews facing not only quota cuts but also cuts in the permitted number of days at sea.  He said the EU fisheries management system “would bring tears to the eyes of a North Korean!”  “The European Commission calls for sustainable fishing, but what we need is a sustainable living for our fishermen.”  A new European Common Fisheries Policy is due to be completed by 2012.

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Google,'True rarity': Gigantic alligator gar caught and released in Texas reservoir could break 2 world records," When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Anglers in Texas reeled in a 283-pound alligator gar after a lengthy battle with the enormous fish. Experts say the catch likely breaks a 72-year record.  Anglers recently reeled in a massive 283-pound (128 kilograms) alligator gar after a nearly three-hour tussle on a Texas reservoir, before releasing it back into the murky waters. Experts claim the extraordinary catch could smash a pair of world records dating back to 1951. Art Weston caught the gigantic gar (Atractosteus spatula) on Sept. 2 at the Sam Rayburn Reservoir in east Texas, with assistance from local boat captain Kirk Kirkland while on board Kirkland's vessel, the ""Garship Enterprise."" The hefty fish was around 8.3 feet (2.5 meters) long and had a maximum girth of around 4 feet (1.2 m). It took 2 hours and 45 minutes for Weston to reel in the enormous creature, which left him visibly ""shaking"" from fatigue, Kirkland wrote in a Facebook post. After weighing and measuring the gar, the pair then released it back into the reservoir, which is connected to the Angelina River. Weston and Kirkland have submitted evidence of the catch to the International Game Fish Association (IGFA). Their catch is likely to break the IGFA Men's 6-pound (2.7 kg) line-class record and the IGFA all-tackle record (the biggest catch for any line class) for the species, IGFA representatives wrote on Facebook. However, the record has not yet been officially verified.  Related: What's the biggest freshwater fish in the world?  ""I applaud Art Weston and Kirk Kirkland for their gargantuan catch,"" Solomon David, an aquatic ecologist at the University of Minnesota who runs a research lab that studies alligator gars, told Live Science in an email. It is ""truly a fish of a lifetime,"" he added. Alligator gars that are more than 8 feet (2.4 m) long are very rare, David said. His research group has only ever come across a handful of individuals this long, he added. However, there are records of even larger gars being caught in recent years.   Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The largest ever recorded alligator gar was a 327-pound (148 kg) behemoth that was captured in Mississippi in 2011, David said. But that individual was accidentally caught in a fishing net and so does not count as an IGFA record, he added. In May 2022, anglers caught an estimated 300-pound (136 kg) alligator gar in a bayou near Houston. However, the specimen was never accurately measured because the person who caught it had no interest in breaking the IGFA records. Alligator gars can grow so large because they have an expansive habitat and an abundance of food, David said. They grow very quickly in their early years, reaching up to 2 feet (0.6 m) long in their first year and reaching up to 6 feet (1.8 m) by age 20, he added. Once gars hit 6 feet their growth rate usually slows dramatically, but they can continue to grow for their entire lives, which can possibly last more than 100 years, David said.  Based on the size of the recently caught gar, David suspects that it is somewhere between 50 and 80 years old. However, without its ear bone, or otolith, it is impossible to tell for sure, David said. Otoliths have growth lines, like the rings in trees, that can be used to tell how old a fish is. —'Majestic' 3-ton sunfish sets a new world record for largest bony fish ever discovered —Biggest freshwater fish ever caught is a stingray that weighs nearly as much as a polar bear —Gigantic, 9.4-foot-long catfish is the largest ever caught The size of the individual also suggests it was a female because females can grow much larger than males, he added. David praised the anglers for releasing the massive gar back into the water. ""Alligator gars of this size are a true rarity, and if we want to continue to see large alligator gars, we need to conserve them, especially the giants,"" David said. ""If we continually remove the largest individuals of a population or species, we remove the genes for large growth, which can eventually result in smaller-sized individuals in a population.""

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Google,Sound Tactics For Fall Albies," The Fisherman Advanced Search Over the last half-dozen years or so, the peak of the run in the Sound has occurred towards the end of September and into October. During the late 1990s, false albacore began to make their first sustained appearances in the waters of the Long Island Sound. At that time, many anglers mistakenly thought that these small inshore pelagics were just finicky bluefish. All one had to do was listen to the chatter on marine band radios to confirm their presence: “What are these “bleeping” things? We can’t hook up.” Although times have indeed changed with new techniques and artificial baits, and catch rates are high, there are still some anglers who find hooking and landing albies to be a frustrating game. But a mantra that I adopted along the way is that ‘albies ain’t so tough.’ My journey with false albacore actually began in the mid-1970s when Atlantic bonito were often as prolific in the Sound as were bluefish. Learning to catch those migratory speedsters gave me many insights into catching their football-shaped cousins that now infiltrate the Sound. The behaviors and migration patterns of bonito, in many ways, parallel those of little tunny. While the numbers of bonito now visiting the Sound have diminished, false albacore populations have flourished. Although numbers may vary year to year, there have been times when the visiting population of albies in the Sound has rivaled the fabled Montauk runs. After catching countless false albacore over the years on both light tackle and fly gear, the following experiences might shed some light on your own fishing quest for these eagerly awaited and worthy opponents. Albies make relatively predictable appearances in the Sound during late August and build in intensity and mass as the fall advances. Over the last half-dozen years or so, the peak of the run in the Sound has occurred towards the end of September and into October. Much of that has to do with the effects of climate change on water temperatures and the movement of bait. In some years, anglers might still find pockets of albies around well into November. During the initial phases of the run, a few concentrated pods will enter the Sound, and those early fish are often very “hot” and responsive to artificial baits. Those few pods can quickly develop into many fish dispersed throughout the Sound. One of the critical elements for a continuing albie run is the presence of solid bait concentrations. Fat Albert’s will readily consume silversides, spearing, bay anchovies, peanut bunker, and small snappers. Some of the best runs of albies track with the presence of large masses of rain bait like bay anchovies. Schooling albies will consistently frequent harbors, inlets, rock promontories, shoals, tidal pond outflows, and offshore areas. It is quite the sight to see false albacore herd bay anchovies into tight quarters in quiet backwaters and then systematically assault them. Any configuration of structure that causes currents and tide to move in such a way as to tumble bait about is a potential area of opportunity. A friend and I once caught albies in such skinny water that it felt like catching bonefish on a tropical sand flat. The Long Island Sound false albacore run builds to a crescendo in mid-fall with fish spread out from western Sound out to the areas surrounding Orient Point. The East End of the North Fork is where numbers of fish can often be measured in terms of acres; late September and October are the two best months for the hottest albie action. False albacore are reasonably tolerant of changes in water temperature and will often remain in the waters of the Long Island Sound through the middle of the fall. In exceptional years, they have been caught into the early days of November. Find the bait and locate suitable water temperatures, and chances are good for enjoying an extended hardtail season long after others have given them up for their voyage south. Albies are members of the same family of fish as mackerel and tuna. They are hydrodynamic speedsters built somewhat along the template of larger, stouter true tuna. A unique identifying characteristic of little tunny is a series of dark spots that look somewhat like fingerprints between the pectoral and ventral fins. Another telltale feature is the wavy and worm-like, vermiculated markings located on the backs of albies, somewhat behind the shoulder area. The general coloration of albies is an iridescent blue-green hue with a dark back and a mottled white to the silvery lower flank region and belly. Like other tunas and mackerel, albies, light up when first caught with an almost neon-sign quality. Most Long Island Sound albies run up to about eight pounds, but they do reach sizes in our area up to 12 and 15 pounds. A previous NYS record false albacore of 16 plus pounds was caught in the eastern Sound. Albies typically follow their close cousins, Atlantic bonito, and Spanish mackerel inshore. Much like bluefish, the surface feeding activity of albies attracts the attention of terns and gulls — and an armada of light-tackle boats. This feeding pattern is often mistakenly thought to be the work of choppers. One of the differences of this topside feeding behavior is that bluefish will slash and splash, while albies attack with surgeon’s precision and lightning speed, often leaping and proposing from the water as they herd and corral bait. Hard tails will dash from point to point with incredible velocity; here one minute, gone the next! Fewer terns will often be on the fast-moving and leaping pods of littler tunny, unlike the extensive mayhem that takes place over huge schools of bluefish. I have often been clued to the whereabouts of an actively feeding albie pod just by the presence of a single following and diving tern. The arrival of no other sport fish causes as much crazed chaos among the light tackle and fly-fishing community as does the appearance of migrating “tunny .” Anglers wait all season for this fish to finally show its fins. Albies can be finicky feeders or voracious gluttons. They can either totally ignore your best offering or hit with reckless abandon anything thrown their way. While they may seem difficult to hook at times, albies will readily take flies, small tins, plugs, and plastics. False albacore are schooling fish, so find one, and there will be plenty more around, usually in the form of small pods that work in concert to corral and push bait to the surface, a trait beneficial to light tackle and fly anglers. The standard fishing methodology for albies involves mostly visual observations of feeding fish. Their tendency to leap from the water after prey is frequently the giveaway to their presence. Diving birds following pods of albies are another indicator of activity. You will often observe terns or gulls behaving somewhat differently than they do when atop schools of feeding bluefish or stripers. In those cases, the birds appear to almost linger for a bit as they hover above the feeding fish while picking off the hapless bait. When following little tunny, the movement of birds is much more frenetic as they keep pace with the fast-moving fish. The pure speed of the albies is what presents a real challenge to the angler. Flipping a fly or lure into the melee takes speed of cast, accuracy, and some modicum of discipline, especially with the fly rod. The traditional casting approach when fishing from a boat is to get into the feeding zone and wait for albies to bust bait on the surface. The angler should attempt to determine, as best as possible, the feeding direction of the pod and try to intercept that path — much easier said than done. When the fish surface, make a quick, accurate cast ahead of the group and in a manner that will have the fly or lure pass in front of the feeding fish. Retrieves can vary, but one of the more popular methods with a fly rod is the double overhand retrieve, stripping line with one hand and then the other at a rapid pace. When a fish takes, a combination strip set and rod lift work well in tandem to drive the hook home. Slow, long, single-handed pulls also can be effective. A stripping basket comes in handy when retrieving in this fashion and aids immensely with line control. I’ve found that getting the fly or other artificial into motion quickly can often be the key to hook-up success when targeting surface-feeding hardtails. Once in an area frequented by fish, blind-casting can also yield results. Lighter-sized gear is not only more efficient for catching the fish but, if matched properly to the size of the quarry can also minimize the fight and reduce the stress on those fish that are to be released. Lines of 10 to 12-pound test diameters enable a small lure to get into the zone quickly and allow the angler to cast lighter artificials much farther than heavier and thicker lines. This is also helpful when fast casts are made into the wind. With spinning gear, this one element of smaller line diameter has been the key to the consistency of hook-ups. With a fly rod, my preferred line is a 15-foot sink tip. I have had much more success with this line than either floating or lesser-density intermediate sink tips. While you can certainly subdue albies with an eight-weight rod, 9-foot nine or 10-weight is preferred. False albacore will readily take the easy pickings from the table. Once a pod of fish slashes through baitfish, they will often remain in the area to pick off remnants of the carnage. I’ve watched injured spearing flutter slowly down the water column, only to be snatched from their free fall by a supercharged albie materializing from the depths. Albies will hang around to capitalize on these easy meals, and as such, “do-nothing” retrieves also work well. After the initial casting to breaking fish, allow the fly or lure to simply descend with minimal retrieving action. Every once in a while during the descent, move the line ever so slowly, as if the fly or lure were an injured or stunned baitfish attempting to regain its stability. When employing this technique with a fly rod, it pays to have a fly that will display flash while flickering down. I make it a point to keep a rod rigged with a sinking tip or sinking line at the ready for just these situations. The same technique works well with small tins and even swimming plugs; let tins flutter, and stop and start a retrieve with plugs. Albies can also be caught from the beach, from jetties, and other locations where they are able to push and pin baitfish. Catching them by wading an open beach is a tough proposition since they move about so quickly, yet it can be done with a reasonable degree of regularity. The best approach for this type of fishing is to select an area albies are known to frequent and just hang loose until they show. This game takes patience and a bit of good fortune. Try to position yourself in such a way as to be close to areas where the fish corral the bait. When I first started fishing for albies that is precisely what I did. I’d hang in the area so long that other boaters would come over to check on me and see if all was okay. They’d leave, the albies would show, and all was good with the world. For some, fishing for albies adds new meaning to the term run and gun — a process of chasing down pods of surface-feeding fish. Albies have a fondness for smaller bait and, therefore, smaller flies. I have caught them on the smallest of saltwater flies, but I have also seen them caught on the largest plugs. Two of their favored baitfish are bay anchovies and small spearing. There are times when albies get extremely selective, particularly when they are zoned in on diminutive baits. That is usually when the fishing is most frustrating, and the angler has to match size, color, and profile exactly. Yet, there are also times when they will feed indiscriminately on larger bait and eat whatever fly or lure you toss at them. One of the biggest challenges an angler faces when casting to fall run albies feasting on masses of anchovies is getting the artificial noticed. Therefore, it is sometimes effective to go against the flow of bait and show the fish something that stands out from among the pack of bait — a distinctly different profile and form. For me, this means somewhat bigger and flashier artificials — attention grabbers. Some of the more popular flies in use on Long Island for albies are:  Small to medium Deceivers, medium to large Clouser Deep Minnows, Epoxy Baitfish patterns, Bonito Bunny, Foxy Bone, and Glass Minnows. Patterns and lures that replicate bay anchovies (rain bait), spearing, peanut bunker, and sand eels are especially effective. As for small tins, you can sample the following:  Epoxy jigs, Krocodile Spoons, Crippled Herring, Deadly Dick, Kastmaster, an old favorite- the Sidewinder, small Hopkins, small diamond jigs, and Yo-Zuri Minnow Jigs. Soft baits like Sluggos, Hogys, and Albie Snax are also very effective. And don’t forget to give small swimming and top-water plugs a try as well, like Yo-Zuri’s Edge Minnow. Be creative; you will be amazed at what frenzied albies will hit.

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Google,Fish and Overfishing," How are fish stocks changing across the world? How much is overfished? By: Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser This article was first published in October 2021 and last updated in March 2024. Many thanks to Ray Hilborn, Michael Melnychuk, Max Mossler, and Daniel Hively from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database for providing data and feedback for this project. See all interactive charts on fish and overfishing ↓ Other research and writing on fish and overfishing on Our World in Data: The world produces around 200 million tonnes of fish and seafood every year. This comes from a combination of wild fish catch and fish farming. In fact, the rapid growth of aquaculture over the last few decades means we now produce more seafood from fish farms than we do from fisheries. Which countries produce the most seafood? We can break this down by wild catch and fish farming. But let’s first look at total production from the sum of these two methods. This is shown in the map here. China is the world’s largest seafood producer. The chart here shows the distribution of wild fish catch by country. This is total seafood production minus aquaculture (fish farming). By clicking on any country, you can see how its production has changed over time. The two charts here show the distribution of fish farming (also known as ‘aquaculture’) by country. First is the global distribution, as shown on the map. Second, as in the regional breakdown, you can also add and compare countries using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Most of the world’s growth in aquaculture production has come from East Asia and the Pacific. For example, China produces more food from aquaculture than any other country. This growth in aquaculture has played an important role in increasing global seafood production without sacrificing fish stocks. Production has continued to grow while the output of wild fisheries has slowed or even plateaued. This allows us to maintain sustainable fishing levels that do not deplete wild fish populations. Most records of global fish catch only date back decades. But, of course, fishing is an industry that dates back much further. We don't have good global records that go so far back in time, but we can draw upon data from some rich countries that have statistical records dating back centuries. This gives us insights into how modern-day fishing compares to the more distant past. In the chart here, we see five centuries of cod catch in Eastern Canada.1 These fishing records date back to the year 1500. We see that fish catch started to increase from around 1700 through to the mid-20th century. It peaked in 1968 before a collapse in fish stocks led to a dramatic decline. In fact, fisheries were forced to close 24 years later, in the early 1990s. Since then, stocks have not been able to recover due to the reopening of fisheries and their overexploitation afterward. Historical records from the UK give us a further understanding of the long-term trend in fisheries. In their paper, published in Nature, researchers Ruth Thurstan and colleagues reconstruct UK fisheries trends dating back more than a century.2 This measures the catch of bottom-dwelling fish – excluding shellfish. We see a steep rise in fish catch over the first half of the 20th century. The development of steam trawlers in the 1880s allowed vessels to fish further offshore, for longer periods of time, and with gear that could reach deeper into the ocean. This increase in fish catch was interrupted by the two World Wars: we see the dramatic declines in catch shown on the chart. This inter-war decline was due to a couple of factors: fishing became much more dangerous, and vessels were redirected from fishing towards military and other uses.3 Even after the World Wars, the fish catch began to dramatically decline over the second half of the 20th century. We might hypothesize that this decline was the result of reduced fishing efforts. But, this is not reflected in the data on fishing activity. When we look at the amount of fish caught per unit of fishing power (the number of fishing vessels multiplied by the fishing effort per vessel) we also see a dramatic decline. This shows the reduction in catch has been driven by a decline in the availability of bottom-living fish rather than changes in fishing efforts. Say the word ‘fishing’, and very different images come to mind. Some of us might picture a lone fisherman with a wooden fishing rod. Others will picture a 100-meter-wide net being dragged along the seafloor by an industrial ship. There are a variety of ways to catch fish. These matters because they depend on what fish we want to catch, how much fish we can catch (and ultimately, the amount of fish we have to eat and the income fishers get), and what the ecological impacts are. Discussions on fisheries can be full of jargon. If you’re not familiar with this research, it can be difficult to understand exactly what each method looks like and what it entails. To make this easier, I have created the following visualization, which presents an overview of the most common fishing methods. This is based on summary visuals from the Marine Stewardship Council. This gear is used across the world, but there are some general patterns where certain methods are more widely used. Pole-and-line, longline, and gillnet methods are more common in lower-income countries where much of the fishing activity is subsistence or small-scale. Purse seine and trawling methods are more common in industrial fishing practices; these tend to catch more fish per unit of effort. However, the downside is that they tend to have larger negative impacts, with more bycatch (catch of fish that are not the target species) and, in some cases, damage to the seabed. Now that we have some understanding of what each of these methods means, let’s look at how common each is. In the charts, we see the breakdown of global wild fish catch by the type of fishing gear used. This data is sourced from the Sea Around Us database, published by Daniel Pauly, Dirk Zeller, and Maria Palomares.4 Globally, bottom trawling is the most common method, accounting for one-quarter of fish catch. Pelagic (midwater) trawling accounts for an additional 10%. This means all types of trawling account for just over one-third of global fish catch. Purse seine fishing is the second most common method, accounting for just over 20% of the catch. Gillnets and longlines account for much less of global fish catch. This is partly a result of the fact that they achieve less catch per landing than methods such as trawling or purse seine. It’s interesting to see how common methods are across different countries. You can explore this data for any country using the + ‘Edit countries and regions’ on the interactive charts. For example, we see that bottom trawling is the dominant method used in China. In contrast, bottom trawling is becoming less common across Europe. In many countries – such as the UK, Spain, and Portugal – bottom trawling was intense throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s but has since declined significantly. That has been partly driven by efforts to reduce overfishing and allow fish stocks to rebuild. In addition, the European Commission banned bottom trawling in deep waters – those below 800m in depth – in 2016. In countries where most fishing is subsistent – Bangladesh is one example – it’s small-scale fishing practices that dominate. Large-scale practices are almost non-existent. Finally, we see that larger-scale practices are growing in some countries as they transition from small, subsistence fishing to larger industrial practices. In Ghana, for example, purse seine is one of the most common forms of fishing. Fish and seafood is an important source of nutrition for many people across the world. Not only does it provide an important source of protein, but fish also contains other nutrients and vitamins that are important for overall health, such as vitamin A, calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.5 How much fish do people across the world eat, and how much of our nutrition does it provide? Some countries in the world eat close to 100 kilograms of seafood per person each year. Others average only a few kilograms. In the charts here, we see the average per capita consumption of fish and seafood across the world.6 The highest seafood consumers are countries including Iceland, the Maldives, and Hong Kong. Contrast that with those at the bottom of the table: landlocked countries such as Mongolia, Afghanistan, and Niger understandably eat relatively little fish. There is a strong relationship between income and overall meat consumption: as we get richer, we tend to eat more meat. This relationship is not as strong for seafood. Many lower-income countries rely on subsistence fishing as a key food source. How much of our total protein, from plant and animal sources, comes from seafood? In the chart here, we see the per capita protein intake from different sources across the world. Globally, less than 10% of total protein intake comes from seafood.7 In some countries, it accounts for a much larger share: around one-third in the Maldives and one-fifth in Japan, Iceland, and Cambodia. It’s possible to get all of the protein we need from plant sources. However, to get all of the amino acids (the building blocks of protein) from a plant-based diet, one needs to have the right variety of foods. It requires a balance of staples such as cereals and more complete proteins such as legumes (peas and beans). Unfortunately, many in poorer countries are heavily reliant on cereals and lack this dietary diversity. In this case, animal protein sources can be vitally important for human health. So, how much of our animal protein comes from seafood? Globally, around one-sixth of our animal protein comes from seafood.7 In the charts here, we see the breakdown of animal protein consumption by country. In some countries, seafood dominates. It accounts for the majority of animal protein in Cambodia, Bangladesh, and the Maldives. For billions of people across the world, fish is an important source of nutrition. Fish plays an important role in nutrition for communities across the world. For many, it is a key source of high-quality protein and provides other vital micronutrients for health. However, people also rely on fishing and fish farming as primary sources of income. How many people are employed in these industries? The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates around 60 million people globally are employed as fishers (catching wild fish) or fish farming (aquaculture). The breakdown of employment by region and the split between fisheries and fish farming is shown in the chart. More people are employed in wild catch than fish farming: a difference of 39 million to 21 million. Unsurprisingly, Asia is home to most of the world’s fishers and fish farmers. The following chart shows us how employment has changed over recent decades. Globally, employment in the industry has increased, but with much faster growth in aquaculture. In 1995, fish farming was a relatively small industry, but it has grown rapidly in the last few decades. More of our seafood now comes from aquaculture than from wild catch. Employment in fishing has increased in every region except Europe. The number of fishers across Europe peaked around the year 2000 and has markedly declined since then [you can view these trends by region using the blue “Change region” button]. The seafood industry is not only an important source of nutrition for many; it is also a key source of income for millions of people. Both those employed directly as fishers or fish farmers and those employed through indirect jobs such as food processing, sourcing, and the management of fisheries. Is the global fishing industry sustainable? Which types of fish are we harvesting sustainably, and where are we overfishing? These are critical questions, but to answer them, we need to first agree on what ‘sustainability’ actually means when it comes to fishing. One of the biggest conflicts I see is not actually about technical discussions of how much fish we catch or whether populations are increasing or decreasing, but a larger ethical conflict in how we view fish. When we view fish through different lenses, these debates don’t get very far. One school of thought views fish as animals with their own inherent value. In this realm, our end goal is often to restore wild animal populations to as close to their pre-human levels as possible. Ultimately, this means we should be catching very little (if any at all). The other school of thought views fish as a resource. Most of us eat fish; hundreds of millions rely on it for nutrition and income across the world. This is incompatible with restoring populations to their historical levels because we can’t do that and catch lots of fish at the same time. Sustainability, in this view, means catching as many fish as possible without depleting fish populations any further. This ties in with the classic Brundtland definition of sustainability: “meeting the needs of the current generation, without sacrificing the needs of future generations”. We catch as many fish as possible to meet the needs of people alive today but don’t take too much such that populations decline, and this sacrifices catch for future generations. We can see these two schools of thought emerge in the typical diagram of sustainable fishing. On the x-axis, we have fishing pressure; as we move towards the right, we catch a larger proportion of the fish stock each year. Fishing pressure tells us about the fraction of the fish population that is caught in a given year. Note that this measure is a flow – it is an input variable that changes over time. On the y-axis, we have fish biomass, which is given as two variables. First, we have the fish catch – shown as the red line. This, again, is a flow variable. Second, we have fish stocks. The fish stock is the total amount of fish left in the population. It, as we'd expect, is a stock variable. Let’s first look at the ‘stock’ line. This is the amount of fish we have in the oceans. It slopes downwards towards the right: if we fish very little, then lots of fish are left in the ocean, and as we increase fishing pressure, we deplete the amount of fish in our oceans. This makes sense. Our first school of thought – that fish are not a resource but a wild animal population in their own right – suggests we should be aiming for the top-left corner. Fish populations are as close to pre-human levels as possible. To do this, we need to catch very little (if any) fish. Our second school of thought – that fish are a resource – would consider the optimal level to be the red dot. This is what is called the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. This is a key concept in fishery research and industry. It’s the largest long-term average catch that can be taken from a fish stock under prevailing environmental and fishery conditions. If you get greedy and catch more than this, then you deplete populations for future generations. If you catch too little, then you’re sacrificing food and income for the current generation. Most fisheries are aiming for this sweet spot: catching not too much, not too little, just right. The tension between these two schools becomes obvious. The optimal outcome is completely different. When the biomass of a fish stock is at the point where the ‘maximum sustainable yield’ can be achieved, it’s around half of its original virgin biomass.8 This level can vary between fish populations but is typically in the range of 37% to 50% of its pre-fishing levels. This may seem counterintuitive, but wild animal population growth rates are often greatest when the population size is moderate and before the population starts to reach its natural limit, or carrying capacity. In other words, if you view fish as a resource, you probably want fish populations to be less than half the size of pre-fishing size in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield. Most of the research, industry, and policymaking is geared towards the second school: viewing fish as a resource. Therefore, much of our work on fish on Our World in Data will explore these concepts and explain what the research and data tell us about fish stocks, catch, and the sustainability of fishing across the world. However, we will also offer the perspective of the first school by looking at how fish populations have changed from their pre-human levels. Sustainable fishing, by its fisheries definition, is catching just the right amount. If you harvest too much, then fish stocks decline. If you catch too little, then you’re giving up valuable food resources and income. In the previous section, we take a closer look at different concepts of sustainable fishing and how this ‘sweet spot’ – the maximum sustainable yield – is defined. How much of the world’s fish is caught sustainably? This is often measured in terms of fish stocks. A fish stock is a subpopulation of a particular species of fish with common parameters such as location, growth, and mortality. Often, it’s a species of fish in a given location. Indian Ocean tuna, for example. Importantly, this metric treats each fish stock as being equal, regardless of how big each stock is. A stock where we catch 1000 tonnes is counted the same as a stock where we catch 10 tonnes. When defining the sustainability of fisheries, we need to know three terms: Overfished: this is sometimes termed ‘overexploited’. A fish stock with abundance below the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is potentially considered ""overfished"". Fish stocks become overexploited when fish are caught at a rate higher than the fish population can support. Maximally sustainably fished: this has sometimes been termed ‘fully fished’ or ‘fully exploited’ in the past. Some might interpret these terms negatively, but this is actually the ‘sweet spot’ that fisheries are aiming for. This is the maximum sustainable yield, where we’re catching as much fish as possible without reducing fish populations below the most productive level. Underfished: this is when the fish stock is greater than the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield. We could catch more fish without the decline of fish populations. From a resource point of view, this is suboptimal because we’re missing out on a key food source and income source from fishing communities. The breakdown of these three categories is shown in the chart. Combined, underfished and maximally fished would be considered to be sustainable because fish stocks are not declining. One-third (34%) of assessed global fish stocks were overfished in 2017. However, 60% were maximally fished, and 6% were underfished. But this does not tell us how much fish was sourced sustainably. This is because fish stocks can be very different sizes. Let’s say we have two fish stocks. Stock A is sustainable, and we’re catching 80 tonnes of fish per year. Stock B is unsustainable, and we’re catching 20 tonnes from it. If we aggregate them, we’d conclude that only half of our fish stocks are sustainable, but 80% of our catch is. When we adjust for the different amounts of catch from each stock, we find that almost four-fifths (79%) of fish catch is sourced sustainably. 21% of the catch comes from overfished populations. Overall, two-thirds of assessed fisheries are sustainable, providing four-fifths of our seafood. This gives us a static view of global fisheries, but how has this been changing over time? Are things getting worse? The chart here shows the status of the world’s fish stocks from the 1970s. The share of overfished stocks has increased over the last half-century. In the 1970s, around 10% were overexploited. Although exploitation rates varied year-to-year, this generally increased through the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Over recent decades, there has been some variability, but overfishing has hovered around one-third globally. Some regions are fishing much more sustainably than others. In the following section, we look at which are managing well and which are doing poorly. Sometimes, there are claims that seem so far-fetched that it’s hard to imagine they need to be addressed. But this is one that simply won’t die – it has been repeated so many times that many believe it to be true. It hit the headlines again after being featured in the popular Netflix documentary Seaspiracy earlier this year. It made the claim that: ""If current fishing trends continue, we will see virtually empty oceans by the year 2048"". Seaspiracy is far from the first source to repeat this claim: Google “empty oceans by 2048,” and you will find hundreds of thousands of results. What’s the story here? Where did this claim come from, and is it true? In 2006, the fisheries researcher Boris Worm and his colleagues published a paper in Science on the trends in biodiversity loss in the world’s oceans.9 The year 2048 and prospects for ‘global collapse’, were only mentioned once and featured in the conclusion of the article: Our data highlight the societal consequences of an ongoing erosion of diversity that appears to be accelerating on a global scale. This trend is of serious concern because it projects the global collapse of all taxa currently fished by the mid–21st century (based on the extrapolation of regression to 100% in the year 2048). How did they reach this conclusion? Well, they plotted the historical decline in ‘collapsed taxa’, as shown in the chart. If we take this black trend line and continue extrapolating it into the future, it will cross 100% in 2048. In other words, if we assume taxa continued to collapse at a constant rate, it would reach zero by mid-century. This raises the important question of what the authors meant by the term ‘collapse’ and how it was calculated. They defined a ‘collapse’ as the case where fish catch was below 10% of their historical recorded maximum. Their data came from the UN FAO database on fisheries ‘landings’ (the amount of fish brought back to land). At the time, there was a lack of high-quality data on fish abundance, so there was only catch data to go on. Unfortunately, this somewhat broad-brush projection was the highlight picked up by the media. The New York Times ran the headline “Study Sees 'Global Collapse' of Fish Species"", and coverage snowballed from there. Even if the authors’ projection did come true, and fisheries did collapse by 2048, the leap to “the oceans will be empty in 2048” is scientifically implausible. The definition of a fisheries collapse is not an ocean of no fish. Catch may be low because populations have been depleted. But there are clearly still fish: we're still catching them. Obviously, this is not an optimal place to be, whether you care about the fish or the fishers. But it does not mean an empty ocean. As we will see later, this prediction has not played out in reality. The aftermath of their paper in 2006 created a lot of uproar in the fishery research community. There were many rebuttal papers challenging this position. The research community had previously been divided: one camp had a more optimistic take on the status of the world’s fisheries and prospects for the future; one had a more pessimistic take. Boris Worm fell into the latter. To their credit, these two sides soon joined forces, working collaboratively to get a much larger and more rigorous overview of the status of the world’s fish populations. The figureheads on both sides of the debate – Ray Hilborn and Boris Worm – both featured in a debate on National Public Radio. In the aftermath, they formed a collaborative project facilitated by the National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis (NCEAS) to get to the bottom of it. Rather than relying on reported data on fish catch, the scientists set out to build a database on global fish stocks. This does not focus on the amount of fish being caught but the abundance of fish in each population. Scientists can do this through a combination of sonar acoustic methods (which lets them build a picture of the number and density of fish) and fishing (which lets them identify specific species in the ecosystem). They published their results in 2009 in the journal Science.10 They concluded that although around two-thirds of assessed fisheries are below the biomass that would give us the maximum sustainable yield, catch is now within or even below sustainable levels in 7 of the 10 studied ecosystems. In other words, while many stocks are still in a poor state, things are improving across many ecosystems. The decline that Worm et al. projected in their earlier paper has not come true. Many fisheries are in a stable position and do not follow the projected curve of collapse. The divergence of these two trends is shown in the chart. First, in red, we see the observations in the Worm et al. (2006) paper from UN FAO catch data. We see that by extrapolating the trend line, it will reach 100% in 2048. In blue, we see the more recent data from Worm and Hilborn’s collaboration on fish stock (abundance) data. It shows a more stable trend in collapse stocks over the last few decades. This mirrors the UN FAO's assessment of fisheries. It estimates that around one-third of the world’s fish stocks are overexploited: these populations are declining because we’re catching more fish than can reproduce. The other two-thirds, though, are sustainable and not in decline. The share that is overexploited has been relatively stable in recent decades. It has not continued at the rates predicted. The most recent analysis of global fish stocks – published by the same group in 2020 – reaffirms this result.11 There are certainly fish stocks that are of major concern. But overall, the majority of regions where we have high-quality data are at least stable.12 To be clear, this does not undermine the fact that some of the world’s fish populations are struggling. Many are in trouble and are at risk of collapse if we do not take action. But the notion that the world’s fisheries will collapse within decades is wrong. Even the original authors do not stand by this statement.13 The extrapolation of this original claim to the “oceans will be empty by 2048” is nonsense that does not reflect the science that underpins it. The health of the world’s fish populations is one of our biggest concerns when it comes to the sustainability of fishing. Compared to other meats, seafood has a low environmental footprint when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and nutrient pollution – we looked at this later on. But with wild fish populations, we have another dimension to consider: what’s happening to their population numbers. When we catch fish faster than they can reproduce, these numbers decline. Earlier on, we looked at assessments of overfishing, and we found that around one-third of global fish stocks are overfished. [A ‘fish stock’ is a fish population in a given location – Bluefin Tuna in the Pacific Ocean, for example]. This is useful but doesn’t really tell us how fish stocks around the world are doing. As consumers, we want to know what types of fish to buy or where to source them. At the industry, national, or global level, we want to know this so we can take action on the stocks that are not doing well. What do we know about the health of fish stocks across the world? There are several methods we use to better understand the health of fish stocks. One method is small-scale scientific surveys in specific regions. This certainly gives us some indication of fish populations, but they are often localized and don’t give us a complete health profile. The second is to do large-scale stock assessments. These assessments have become the bedrock of fisheries management. The RAM Legacy database – first launched in 2009 – is led by a team at the University of Washington – and is the most widely used in research and is adopted by the UN Fisheries Division. Back in 2009, it covered 166 of the world’s fish stocks, which accounted for around 20% of global fish catch.10 Today, it covers over 1,200 fish stocks, which is more than 50% of the global catch. It covers many of the world’s key fishing regions: the United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Europe, Peru, Chile, Argentina, high-seas tuna fisheries, New Zealand, and Japan, plus most of the major fisheries of South Africa and Australia. Unfortunately, there are key regions where we have very little data. The database is missing data from most Asian, African, and Latin American fisheries. We see this in the map, which details the coverage of fish stocks in the RAM database. Most fisheries across Europe and the Americas have good coverage. Most fisheries across Asia do not. We will soon look at what’s happening to fish stocks in the regions for which we have good data. But first we should see what we know (if anything) about the stocks that are missing. Stock assessments are used by fisheries across the world to understand the health of fish populations and implement strategies to manage their fisheries. For example, they might be used to set catch limits at levels that are sustainable, given the dynamics and health of the fish population. They are carried out using the ‘ABC’ method. This is the collection of three key metrics: A = Abundance. Scientists use acoustics and other methods to monitor and estimate the abundance of fish at any given time. B = Biological factors. Sampled fish are taken to assess the age and population growth rate of the population. For example, we might need to know the ratio of adult versus juvenile fish to estimate the reproduction rate of the population. C = Catch. Data is collected on how many fish are being caught. Scientists then used these three inputs – abundance, biology, and catch – to model the population dynamics of the fish stock. Abundance and biology tell us how many fish we would otherwise expect to be there before we remove any. Catch tells us how many we’re taking out. The balance of these two gives us an estimate of how many there really are. We don't have good stock assessments across Asia, Africa (except South Africa), and much of Latin America. But can we say anything about how they might be doing? Well, first, the very fact that we don’t have good data is itself bad news. Managing the sustainability of fisheries is a delicate process – to do it well we need continual monitoring of the fish populations, their reproduction rate, and how much fish we’re catching. This balance can change from season to season or even month to month as environmental factors change and affect the dynamics of the ecosystem. Regions that manage fisheries well are constantly monitoring and changing catch limits when necessary. Fisheries that are not carrying out these assessments will struggle to maintain this balance. That’s most of the fisheries across Asia, Africa, and South America. Fishing pressure in many of these regions is intense. Bottom-trawling – where large fishing nets are dragged along the seabed – is very high in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia. Maintaining such high rates of fishing without monitoring them closely makes it unlikely that fish stocks are in a healthy state. One of the ways that we can assess the pressure from trawling is to look at how many times a given area of the seabed is trawled. Some areas are only trawled once every few years. Others are trawled over and over. Research suggests that where stocks are healthy, a net only passes over the same spot once in a period of 3 to 10 years. Across Asia, it’s common for the same area to be trawled 3 to 10 times per year. This has been confirmed by some smaller scientific surveys in the region. Scientific surveys have periodically monitored stocks in the Gulf of Thailand for decades. They show a large reduction in fish stocks over time. Other surveys of trawling efforts across the region show similar declines. Ask local experts about the state of fish stocks, and most have a similar take: they are in poor condition.14 Of course, it won’t apply to all fisheries across these regions. Some will be well-managed and healthy. But, based on what we know (and especially the fact that we don’t know a lot), the consensus is that many of these fish stocks are not in a healthy place. Let’s then turn to the health of fish across the regions for which we do have good assessments. It so happens that these tend to be richer countries: those across Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan. This database covers over 1,200 of these fish stocks, over half of the world’s fish catch. In the chart, we see how these stocks are doing. It shows the biomass of fish populations. That is, essentially, the amount of wild fish there. It’s the number of fish multiplied by their mass. Here, we’re measuring these stocks relative to the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. The maximum sustainable yield is the sweet spot where we can catch as many fish as possible without reducing the fish population below the most productive level. A value of one is the ‘optimal’. We’re maximizing fish catch while keeping populations stable. A value greater than one is good for fish populations (there are more fish) but not good for humans since we’re missing out on fish catch. A value below one is not good: fish stocks are lower than we’d like, and while we might catch more fish in the short term, we will miss out in the longer term. You can add more regions using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Fish stocks are healthy across most of these regions. Australia, Alaska, the US Northeast and Southeast Coasts, Japan, and Europe Atlantic are all above one another, hovering around this optimal value. However, there are a few regions that are not doing so well. The Canadian East Coast has seen a large decline in recent years. Assessed stocks in South America and Africa are struggling. The European Mediterranean is not doing well. This is reflected in the fact that the Black Sea is very overfished. Whether a fish stock is doing well or not is mainly determined by its fishing intensity: what fraction of the population is being caught each year. Fish too much, and the population can’t be maintained. In this chart, we see levels of fishing intensity across the same regions. Again, this is measured relative to the intensity at the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. An optimal value is one. If the intensity is greater than one, then we’re overfishing. Fish stocks tend to be a lagging indicator of fishing intensity. So, if we hold fishing intensity too high (above one) – even if only slightly – then stocks will inevitably fall below one until fishing pressures are reduced. The status of stocks across different regions might tell us where we might find healthy stocks – and, as a result, where we might want to source our fish from – but they’re averaged across many types of fish. It doesn’t tell us about what fish we might want to buy or avoid. How are stocks of tuna, cod, mackerel, or sharks holding up? In the chart, we see the same metric as before – fish stocks measured by biomass – across different types. Across most of the main fish groups – tunas, shrimp, cod, and perch – stocks are at or above ‘one’ – the sweet spot where we catch as many fish as possible while keeping populations stable. That’s good news. Many of our most popular stocks are well-managed and have healthy populations. A few groups are not faring so well. In recent years, mackerel have dropped below the optimal level due to increased fishing intensity. And sharks are declining rapidly – a worrying trend. Let’s look at a few of these species in more detail: tuna, which is doing surprisingly well, and sharks, which are not. The health of tuna populations has been a concern for decades. We often hear that tuna are being overfished to extinction. That we should avoid them if we want to eat sustainably. But many tuna populations are now well-managed. Previously, we looked at the aggregate of tuna stocks; we can zoom in further and look at particular regional stocks. In the chart, we see the health of fish stocks across three oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Tunas in the Atlantic and Pacific are managed close to their ‘maximum sustainable yield’. That’s positive news. The trend looks worse for those in the Indian Ocean. Its stocks have now fallen below one and look to be continuing downwards. Atlantic and Pacific tuna might be a reasonable fish choice. Tuna from the Indian Ocean has less of a guarantee of being from a sustainable source. However, we can go even further and look at specific tuna species, such as bluefin or yellowfin. We see these stocks in the chart. Some tuna stocks have recovered through improved management – especially in the US and European waters. From the chart, we see that many are above one: the maximum sustainable yield. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. Many of the tuna stocks that were the biggest concern have started to turn things around. We see this in this chart, which now shows fish stocks measured as their total mass in tonnes rather than relative to the maximum sustainable yield. Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, we see a massive decline in tuna populations. The Southern bluefin tuna by more than 90% – from over 8.5 million tonnes to less than one million. The Western Pacific yellowfin fell by three-quarters. However, since the millennium, better management of fisheries and reduced overfishing have resulted in many of these stocks showing some signs of recovery. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. While many of the world’s tuna stocks might be starting to recover, shark populations are declining. We previously saw that shark stocks were being overexploited and populations were declining. We see this again in the chart here. What’s even more concerning is that this only tells us about assessed shark populations. Many more stocks have not been assessed – and these are likely to be in regions where monitoring is poor and illegal catch is poorly regulated. There, shark populations might be in even poorer health. In general, sharks and rays tend to grow and reproduce more slowly than other fished species, meaning that it takes longer for individuals who have been caught to be replaced. This contributes to their increased extinction risk, reflected in the IUCN Red List. A third of the world's sharks and rays have been assessed as being threatened with extinction15. However, this slow rate of growth and reproduction is not true of all shark and ray species, and some species can support sustainable fisheries 16. In our Fish Stocks Data Explorer, we present the key metrics for assessed fish stocks from the RAM Legacy Database.17 This provides a high-resolution breakdown of specific fish stocks across the world. For general readers, this might be too detailed. However, it could be useful for those with a background in this area to explore specific fish stocks. One of the best ways to reduce our impact on the environment is by changing what we eat. The research shows us that we can have the biggest impact by eating less meat and dairy. Or substituting lower-impact meats such as chicken and pork for beef and lamb. But I’m often asked the question: “What about fish and seafood? Is that an environmentally-friendly option?”. There are lots of types of seafood: not only different species but also ways of producing them. We can catch them in the wild or grow them in fish farms. But in most comparisons of food products, they’re aggregated into one or two categories, such as “marine fish” or “freshwater fish”. This doesn’t really inform us about what type of fish to eat. Let’s take a closer look at the impacts of specific types of seafood. ‘Environmental impact’ can mean very different things: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use or chemical pollution. It’s useful to look at all of these impacts in case there are large trade-offs between them. In a new study published in Nature, Jessica Gephart and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of the impacts of fish and seafood across multiple environmental metrics.18 To do this, they combined life-cycle analysis data from studies of wild-caught and farmed seafood products. It covered over 1690 fish farms and 1000 records from fisheries. These results look at the impacts on-farm and off-farm, up to the farmgate. That means up to the point that harvested or caught fish are brought back to land. It includes all of the inputs into production, such as fish feed or fuel use in fisheries. It does not include post-farm processes such as transport to retail, packaging, or cooking.19 Here, we’re looking at five key metrics: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, freshwater use, and nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This doesn’t include the sustainability of wild fish stocks, which is obviously another important metric that we need to consider. We looked at what’s happening to global fish stocks earlier on this page. The impacts across the seafood products are shown in the charts. Here, we’re looking at the median across all of the assessed studies.20 These impacts are shown per kilogram of edible weight. That means we’re not including inedible parts such as shells or bones. Comparing fish to other types of fish is useful. But we also want to know how seafood compares to other protein foods. So, we’ve included chicken for comparison.21 Chicken tends to have the lowest environmental impact of meat and dairy products – much less than beef and lamb and a bit better than pork. So when we make this comparison, we’re really seeing how seafood compares to animal protein with the lowest impact. Overall, we see that a lot of seafood has a relatively low environmental impact compared to animal protein sources. Many types have a lower carbon footprint than chicken (those that are higher are around 20-30% higher). Most farmed seafood needs less land and freshwater and causes less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This is because fish tend to be more efficient than chickens in converting feed into meat, which means they need less feed per kilogram. There are some exceptions, though: wild flounder, lobster, and shrimp, for example, can have a high carbon footprint. More than double that of chicken. Related chart: Looking at the median footprints allows us to make quick, general assessments of the high- and lowest-impact species. However, they can hide the variability among a given species based on where and how it’s produced. This makes little difference for some species, but for others, it can have a large impact. In the chart, we see the spread of greenhouse gas emissions among the different types of seafood. The median of each – as we looked at above – is shown as the thick black line for each bar. The width of the bar shows us how variable this can be: it tells us what the largest and smallest impact can be for each species. Wild-caught seafood is shown in blue; farmed seafood is in red. Now we see that not only are there large differences in the median between each. There are also large differences in how variable emissions can be. In general, we tend to see that the impacts of farmed seafood are much less variable than wild-caught; the red bars are much thinner than the blue. Let’s take salmon as an example. The median emissions for farmed and wild-caught salmon are similar; farmed has a slightly lower footprint of 5.1 versus 6.9 kg CO2e per kg. But the big difference comes from the spread of emissions: wild-caught can range anywhere from 1.7 to 17 kg CO2e. That’s a ten-fold difference. Farmed salmon only ranges from 4.1 to 6.2 kg CO2e, a 50% difference between the minimum and maximum. If you choose wild-caught salmon, you could be picking a low-carbon or a high-carbon protein source. It might even be lower than farmed salmon. But if you pick farmed salmon, you are almost guaranteed that it will be relatively low-carbon. We see this across other species, too: see shrimp, for example. The same is true in our comparison to chicken. Chickens have a very low footprint variation. Wild-caught fish such as salmon or tuna can have a lower or higher footprint depending on where and how it’s caught. Some choices that will guarantee a relatively low footprint are farmed bivalves (mussels, oysters, and scallops) and seaweed – these are filter-feeding organisms that also sequester carbon and nutrients in their shells. That is partly why they have such low emissions, and they need no additional land either. Farmed salmon, trout, carp, and catfish are also good choices. What do these results tell us about how seafood fits into a sustainable diet? Again, we should be clear that the most effective way to reduce the impact of your diet is to eat less animal-sourced products overall. On the basis of total protein and calories, plant-based foods such as legumes and soy still have a much lower impact. However, for those who do not want to eliminate animal products completely, seafood can be a good choice. Many types of seafood have a lower impact than chicken. This means they have a much lower impact than foods such as beef or lamb. As we saw earlier on this page, the status of wild fish stocks is mixed. Effective management of fisheries across Europe and North America means that many of these fish stocks are stable and no longer in decline.11 Unfortunately, we know much less about the health of fish stocks across Asia and much of Africa, but many of these stocks are likely to be overfished. That matters for where you source wild-caught fish; sourcing from European or American fisheries might be a safer choice if you want to ensure they are sustainable. The issue of wild fish stock depletion is not an issue for farmed seafood. As these fish tend to also have a low carbon and land footprint, farmed fish can be a low-impact source of protein. Most of the fishing methods we use have some kind of environmental impact – whether it’s burning fuel in fishing boats, unintentionally catching fish or marine animals we don’t want (bycatch), or leaving behind remnants of fishing gear. But dredging – sometimes referred to as bottom trawling – has the largest negative impact. Bottom trawling drags a structure along the seabed – at various depths in the sediment, depending on the specific method – to dislodge organisms such as crustaceans. It’s an incredibly efficient way to catch seafood. That’s why it’s so common: one-quarter of the world’s fish are caught this way. But it usually comes at an environmental cost. In this section, we look at how much of the seafloor is trawled, what the consequences are, and what we can do to reduce its impacts. Let’s first look at the question of how much of the seafloor is affected by trawling. Improved satellite and GPS tracking technologies mean that scientists can now map trawling patterns at high resolution. In a paper published in Nature, Enric Sala and colleagues estimate that around 5 million square kilometers (km2) of seabed is trawled each year.22 In the chart below, I’ve put this into the context of the global seabed area as a whole. The total ocean seabed spans 361 million km2.23 That’s the top bar in the chart. Most of this is deep ocean, far from the world’s continents, and at depths that we rarely visit. Around 10% of the world’s seabed is shallower than 1000 meters – this threshold includes all of the world’s continental shelves and areas that we’d fish in. That means 37 million km2 of seabed is within our scope. That is shown by the second bar. Our 5 million km2 of trawled seabed – shown as the bottom bar – is therefore equal to around 13.5% of the explorable seabed. In the context of the total seabed area, it’s 1.4%. Many have compared this area to the Amazon Rainforest.24 To some extent, the areas do match: the Amazon rainforest spans approximately 5 million km2. But we should be careful about using this comparison. Trawling does not have the same impact as cutting down a primary rainforest. As we will soon see, trawling does kill a lot of life on the seabed, but recovery times can be very quick: in the order of a few months to years. When we cut down the primary rainforest, we lock ourselves into a recovery period of many decades. Maybe even longer. What’s also important to note is that the same areas are often trawled again and again.25 What this means is that it’s not a different 5 million km2 that’s trawled every year. If that were true, within five years, almost all of the shallow seabed would be trawled. Thankfully, that’s not the case. The extent of trawling varies a lot from region to region. In a study published in PNAS, Ricardo Amoroso and colleagues mapped the extent of trawling across different regions.26 They monitored the share of continental shelves – to a depth of 1000m – that was trawled at least once during a period of two to four years.27 Some regions – such as South Chile, Alaska, and the Australian shelves – experienced almost no trawling at all. Others experienced a lot. 80% of the continental shelf in the Adriatic Sea was trawled. 42% of the North Sea was trawled. One-quarter of the shelf in the Irish Sea was. You can see these rates by region here. Passing a trawl over the seabed can have quite a severe impact on the organisms that live there. How much of the biota is affected depends on a couple of factors, including the type of gear used, the type of sediment, and what lifeforms live there. We might imagine that a coral that sticks out from the seabed will be destroyed while organisms deeper in the sediment might survive. Researchers have carried out studies to see what impact trawling has on wildlife – either through experimental methods or observing real-world impacts. In an analysis published in PNAS, Jan Geert Hiddink and colleagues brought these experiments together to build a complete picture.28 The impact of trawling really depends on the type of method and gear that’s used. We see that in the chart below, which shows the impact of four types: otter trawling, beam trawling, towed dregs, and hydraulic dredging. On the y-axis, we have the share of organisms that are removed or killed by a single pass of a trawl over the seabed. On the x-axis, we have the depth of the ocean sediment that the trawl reaches. What we see clearly is that the deeper the trawl digs into the sediment, the more biota we kill. Otter trawls have the lowest impact: they dig just 2.4 centimeters into the sediment, and around 6% of organisms are lost. Beam trawls lose 14%. Towed dredges dig twice as deep, and one-fifth of organisms are killed off. The most damaging method is hydraulic dredging: it digs deep into the sediment at 16 centimeters, and 41% of organisms are destroyed as a result. Once this area has been affected by trawling, how long does it take for its biodiversity to recover? For the ecosystem to get back to its pre-trawling state takes a few years if it’s left alone. In their analysis, Hiddink and colleagues found average recovery times (where ‘recovery’ means getting back to 95% of pre-trawling biomass levels) in the range of 1.9 to 6.4 years. The differences here were dependent on the method used – the shallower otter trawls caused less damage and recovered more quickly than the deep hydraulic trawling – and the environmental context, such as the type of seabed. This finding was consistent with previous studies, finding recovery to be in the range of years [this study, for example, reports a 4-5 year recovery time across multiple commercial trawling sites].29 Several years might seem like a long time, but it’s actually pretty fast for an ecosystem to recover. This is why I don’t find the comparison between dredging and rainforest clearing to be a particularly helpful one. If we cut down the Amazon rainforest, it will be decades, if not centuries, before it gets back to its previous state. Thankfully, these seabed communities recover orders of magnitude more quickly. But, of course, they only recover if we leave them alone. How is bottom trawling changing across the world? Is it becoming more or less common? Globally, bottom trawling rapidly increased through the second half of the 20th century. But it has not changed much since the 1990s. We see this in the chart. What has changed is where bottom trawling is happening. Trawling rates were very high across Europe in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. However, growing concern about the depletion of wild fish stocks has led to a significant reduction in recent decades to allow populations to recover. The cases of the UK, Portugal, and Spain are shown in the chart. Portuguese catch from bottom trawling has fallen by 90% since the 1960s.30 In 2016, the European Commission also banned bottom trawling in deeper water below 800 meters. We see the same in Japan, where the catch peaked in 1972 at 4 million tonnes and has since fallen by around 90% to 400,000 tonnes. Bottom trawling has been growing elsewhere, though. It has been growing rapidly in China and India since the 1980s. Although these rates have stabilized – or even declined – in the last few years. Since most methods of trawling create environmental damage, you might suggest that the best option is to eliminate it completely. But in reality, it is still the most efficient method of catching seafood – which is why so many countries continue to use it. We can limit the use of trawling, which, in fact, many countries have. We just saw examples of this across Europe and Japan. But this will come at the cost of catch and income for communities that rely on it. If we can’t – or don’t want to – eliminate it completely, there are still things we can do to limit its impacts. The types of gear used for trawling can have very different impacts. Some are much more damaging than others. One option is, therefore, to ban specific types of gear rather than completely ban the practice. Another option is to modify the types of gear used to limit their damage to the seabed. For example, the doors on otter trawls are very destructive; newer designs now limit the amount of impact these doors have on the seafloor. In some cases, they eliminate this contact completely. Finally, we can ban trawling in specific locations where the habitat is particularly sensitive. For example, not allowing trawling in areas with coral reefs or important biodiverse habitats such as seagrasses. This would allow trawling activity to continue but would protect important areas of our ocean at the same time. Fish farming – also known as aquaculture – has boomed over the last 50 years. Production has increased more than 50-fold. In fact, we now produce more seafood from aquaculture than we do from wild catch. This has been good news for the health of global fish stocks. Global demand for seafood might have increased, but wild fish populations are finite. If we push beyond the limits of how quickly fish populations recover, this becomes unsustainable. Aquaculture has, therefore, been an ingenious solution: rather than relying on wild fish, we can produce our own. Nearly all of the growth in seafood production in recent decades has come from aquaculture; wild fish catch has changed very little. However, there has been one concern about the rise of aquaculture in relation to wild fish stocks. Like any type of animal farming, we need to feed them. Sometimes, we feed them fishmeal and fish oils. Not all aquaculture species are fed from animal sources, but many are. They don’t necessarily need fishmeal and oils in their diets, but fish farmers often use them because they provide an almost perfect balance of essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids. Many have questioned whether aquaculture is really the solution that it seems. If it is partly fed by wild fish, perhaps more fish farms means more pressure on wild fish stocks? Here, I take us through the numbers to understand how much wild fish catch really goes towards animal feed, how this is changing over time, and whether this undermines the benefits of aquaculture. Let’s first understand the amount of wild fish that is used as feed. In the chart, we see the breakdown of global fish catch in 2017.31 The world caught around 109 million tonnes of fish. 84% of this was used for direct human consumption. The remaining 16% was turned into fishmeal and oils to use as animal feed. 5% went to land-based livestock such as cows, pigs, and chickens. 11% went to aquaculture as feed for farmed fish. This bottom component is what we’re most interested in. In the second bar, we see global aquaculture production. We produce around 112 million tonnes of farmed seafood a year. We should be careful not to interpret this as the total input and output of feed for fish farming. It’s not the case that we put 12.6 million tonnes of feed in and magically get 112 million tonnes of fish back. That would massively overstate the efficiency of fish farms. First, fishmeal is just one of many things that we need to fish, so there are other inputs. Second, many aquaculture species are not fed fishmeal or oils at all. Only a small share of fish catch is used as feed for aquaculture today. However, aquaculture production has grown quickly. If we want to understand how sustainable this is, we need to know how the use of fish for feed has changed over time. In the chart, we see global fish catch since 1950.32  It is broken down by whether it is used for direct human consumption, animal feed, or other uses (which are mainly industrial uses of oils). First, we see that global fish catch has been relatively stable since 1990. If aquaculture was putting pressure on fish production, it’s not obvious from the total catch. When we look at the breakdown, we also see that the amount allocated to fishmeal and oil (animal feed) has not changed much since 1990. It increased a lot from the 1950s through to the 1980s. But since 1990, it has actually declined. This decline is seen even more clearly in this chart, which shows the amount of wild fish used as animal feed (in blue) and aquaculture production (in red).33 As we will see later, in its infancy, the aquaculture industry was inefficient. To produce one fish, you need several fish as feed inputs. That’s part of the explanation for why feed inputs in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s were higher than aquaculture production. Thankfully, aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has declined over the last few decades. This is for several reasons. First, the feed conversion and efficiency of fish farms have improved. Second, we’ve been discovering blends of plant-based ingredients that offer all of the essential nutrients; this reduces the need for fishmeal and oil. As we can see from the chart, aquaculture production increased by 250% between 2000 and 2015. Meanwhile, fish caught for feed actually declined. Aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has been weakening. It’s not the case that more and more aquaculture puts more and more pressure on wild fish. There’s one key metric that we need to understand: the efficiency of fish feed and the FIFO ratio. The Fish In: Fish Out (FIFO) ratio tells us how much fish we need to feed aquaculture species to get one fish back in return. If you have a FIFO greater than 1, you need more fish inputs than you get back from your fish farm. So a ratio of 2 means you need two fish equivalents of fishmeal and oil to be able to produce one fish in return. On the flip side, a ratio of 0.5 means you get two fish back from every fish you put in. In the chart here, we see the FIFO ratio across all of the most common aquaculture species.34 At the bottom, we see the total across all species fed by fishmeal. This shows the change in FIFO in the two decades from 1997 (the red markers) to 2017 (blue markers). In 1997, aquaculture used fish feed very inefficiently. The overall ratio was 1.9, meaning almost two fish were required as inputs to produce one fish in return. This has improved massively in the decades since then. In 2017, this ratio was 0.28: we got three fish back from one fish used as input.35 This improvement came from efficiency gains, as well as a switch to other plant-based feed blends. The FIFO improved for all aquaculture species. Today, this ratio for the most common species – carp, tilapia, and catfishes, shown at the top – is incredibly low. They use very tiny amounts of fishmeal as inputs. On the other hand, farmed salmon, trout, and eel still have unfavorable ratios. This has improved significantly in recent decades but is still well above 1. Hopefully, this ratio will continue to fall. Overall, aquaculture is an important solution to meet the growing demand for seafood. We cannot take endless numbers of wild fish from our oceans, so if we want more fish, we’re going to have to produce our own. A few decades ago, aquaculture’s benefits were questionable. But with massive improvements in efficiency, it is now a net producer of seafood. Fears that a growing aquaculture industry would put more and more pressure on wild fish stocks have not come true. When fishers go out to catch fish, it would be great if they only caught the fish that they need. If they’re fishing for tuna, they catch their daily quota of tuna and leave the rest of the ecosystem undisturbed. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Fishers also catch marine life that they don’t want. Catch that is not the species we’re targeting is called by-catch. Fishers sometimes bring by-catch back to land to eat or sell. But often, they will throw these unwanted fish back into the water. The animals they throw back are called discards. Discards can be dead or alive, but the survival rate is low. Some hardy shellfish might survive, but most discarded fish are dead. There are various reasons why fishers might not want these fish. They might be too small, inedible, damaged, or not give them a good return in the market. Fishers might also have strict quota restrictions on how much they can bring back each day. If they’re over the limit, they will have to throw some fish back. Discards are obviously negative. First, there is the obvious ethical lens of animal welfare – not only are we killing animals, but we’re killing them without an end use or purpose. Killing for no reason. Second, this is an issue that is often hidden from official statistics. Only ‘landings’ – the fish brought back to land – are recorded in most databases, such as those of the UN fisheries. Discards are not reported. It’s hard to understand fish stocks if large numbers of fish kills are going unmonitored. Maintaining sustainable fish stocks relies on us understanding how quickly fish populations regenerate and balancing this with how much fish we catch. Hidden catches could tip this out-of-balance. Thankfully, we are not completely blind. Marine scientists do reconstruct and estimate discards. The UN Fisheries Division also carries out periodic – around once every decade  – assessments to understand the magnitude of the problem. Globally, we throw less than a tenth of the fish and marine animals we catch back into the ocean. We see this in the chart, which shows global fish catch since 1950. This is split into ‘landings’ – catch that is brought back to land – and ‘discards’, the catch that is thrown back into the ocean. Researchers Dirk Zeller, Daniel Pauly, and Maria Palomares can reconstruct this data from estimates of how many discards are captured from different fishing methods.36 For example, the percentage of catch from bottom trawls that ends up being discarded. Their web platform – Sea Around Us – is an excellent resource for understanding global fisheries. The chart shows that the majority of the aquatic animals are brought ashore and used for human or animal consumption. The remaining amount is thrown back into the water. The UN Fisheries Division did an independent assessment of discards and found a similar result.37 It estimated that annual discards (averaged from 2010 to 2014) were around 9.1 million tonnes. That was 10.8% of the total catch. The amount of fish we discard has declined a lot in recent decades. We see this in the other chart, which shows plots that have been discarded since 1950. In the early 1950s, we were throwing around 5 million tonnes of fish away. This increased to 14 million tonnes in 1989. Since then, discards have fallen to around 8 or 9 million tonnes. This is back to levels in the late 1950s. Some fishing methods generate much more discards than others. You’re not going to generate the same unwanted catch using a fishing rod as you are from bottom trawling – dragging a large net along the seafloor. If you’re doing the latter, you’re going to end up with lots of unwanted animals in your net. It’s difficult to discriminate for the particular species that you want. Researchers gather data on how much catch is discarded when different types of fishing gear are used. This gives us what is called the discard rate – what percentage of the total catch is thrown back into the water. The average results across different fishing methods are shown in the chart. Unsurprisingly, trawling has the highest discard rate; half of the catch from shrimp trawls is thrown back in. The fact that trawling tends to have a high discard rate, and it is the method used to catch a lot of our fish, means that around half of global fish discards come from bottom trawling. There are no big winners when it comes to discards. Fish are killed needlessly, and the fact that these fish are not sold or eaten means that no one benefits from more income or food. Reducing discards is a good thing. As we saw earlier, discards have fallen since the 1990s. Why have they declined,  and can we learn to replicate it? One factor has been a rising market value of fish – even the species that fishers do not intend to catch. Fishers are, therefore, incentivized to bring more of their bycatch to land and sell it. That means that even if bycatch did not decline, the amount of discards would. Some countries have implemented a no-discard policy – a ban on discards at sea.37 This is sometimes called a ‘landing obligation’, which means that fishers must keep all of their caught fish on board and bring them back to land to declare as ‘landings’. This policy was implemented by the European Union and was a core part of its Common Fisheries Policy reform in 2013. If fishers have a quota or limit on how much fish they can catch, they have to be much more careful about by-catch – these unwanted fish will still count towards their quota for the day. Improved gear has led to much more selective fishing practices. Over time, gear has been adapted to reduce by-catch. Examples of this include changes in the size and shape of mesh and hook, adding ‘escape panels’ to trap nets, or the use of underwater lights or acoustic alarms.38 This has been shown to be effective in multiple contexts.39 Some countries – Belize is one example – go as far as to ban non-selective fishing gear completely.40 Many of the effective solutions to reduce discards rely on effective monitoring and enforcement of fishery policies. This means that countries that have been successful so far tend to be those with strong fisheries policies. Others lag behind, but there’s no reason to think that they could not do the same. Eliminating by-catch completely might be unrealistic. But the fact that discards have been falling means that we can do something about it. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are areas of ocean – which includes the water column and seafloor – that have been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment. Regulations in marine protected areas can vary but include interventions such as no fishing zones, restrictions on fishing such as the type of gear that can be used, bans or restrictions on activities such as mining, and regulations on inputs to the ocean from rivers and industrial effluents. How much of the world’s ocean is protected today? Here, we have to differentiate between national territorial waters – that is, parts of the ocean typically closer to coastlines that countries have national rights over – and international waters (also called the ‘high seas’) that do not belong to any single country. In the chart, we see the amount in each zone that is protected and unprotected.41 As of 2021, 7.7% of the total ocean is protected. This means 92% is unprotected. We see that much more of the world’s national waters are protected than international ones. In the charts here, we see the share of territorial waters that are protected in each country. This does not include international waters (‘high seas’). Schijns, R., Froese, R., Hutchings, J. A., Pauly, D., & Raicevich, S. (2021).

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Google,Rhode Island's Pending State Record False Albacore,"  Henry Simonds reeled in a jumbo albie while fishing for bluefin tuna around the Block Island wind farm. While a majority of southern New England anxiously waits for albie season to ramp up, on Thursday, August 17th, Henry Simonds of Connecticut reeled in a surprising catch off the coast of Rhode Island. He was fishing around the Block Island wind farm with Captain David Hochman of Spear-It Charters when they received a knock-down, which, unbeknownst to them at the time, would become a contender for the new state record false albacore. Simonds—who spends his time freediving the shallows on the north shore of Massachusetts—began spearfishing with Hochman five years ago and has been doing it ever since. According to Simonds, their initial game plan was to spearfish some yellowfin in the canyons on an overnight trip 40 to 50 miles south of Block Island. But, after suiting up and making a few dives, their group hadn’t seen a single fish. In an effort to put some tuna in the boat, Simonds said that their dive trip became a trolling trip, which ended up boating the crew 8 yellowfin tuna. According to Hochman, a friend of his had just caught a 100-pound bluefin around the Block Island wind farm— an easy pit-stop for the homebound crew. Prepared to round out their box of yellowfin, Hochman and his mate set out a Sterling Tackle side tracker with purple 9-inch bulb squids and a zucchini stinger. Not long after they started to troll around the wind farm, the drag on their Penn International 80W (spooled with 150-pound monofilament) began to sing. Hochman—a longtime commercial tuna fisherman who has has spent his life spearfishing—began Spear-It Charters 15 years ago with guided dive trips. Within the past 10 years, he started additionally offering rod-and-reel charters, chasing the same fish from a new perspective to avoid monotony. He frequently targets false albacore via both methods to use them for bait on his shark charters, but this albie would be larger than any he has encountered in 15 years of guiding. Thinking they hooked a bluefin, Simonds jumped on the rod, tightened the drag and put some pressure on the fish. Hochman described the fight as being more powerful than a football bluefin tuna. “Pound for pound, albies fight harder than bluefin of similar size,” said Hochman. “I’ve caught 50-pound bluefin that didn’t have the power of this near 20-pound albie.” After what was estimated to be a 10- to 15-minute fight due to the initial run it took on light drag, Hochman said they were all surprised to see an albie on the other end of the gaff. “Even on an 80-wide, the fish was so heavy,” said Simonds. “And you would think such a heavy setup would cut down the fight time.” According to the skipper, they were bringing in 70-pound yellowfin in the same amount of time that it took to land this fish which, combined with it’s size, is why they concurred this could be a new state record false albacore. Not one for fanfare, Simonds sounded very humbled by the potential state-record holder status. He doesn’t spend much time chasing albies on light spinning gear as so many crazed inshore anglers do from Cape Cod to New Jersey each year. Moreover, he certainly never anticipated catching a false albacore of this caliber while trolling for tuna. “There wasn’t a big school of them or anything, this fish kind of came out of nowhere and it just happened to be my turn on the rod,” Simonds said. Upon reaching cell phone range, Simonds researched what he needed to do to submit the catch to the state of Rhode Island. The Connecticut native brought his catch to Snug Harbor Marina in Wakefield, where it weighed in at 19.56 pounds and measured 36 inches long. With the appropriate paperwork submitted and the measurements logged and dated, all that’s left to do is wait to hear back from the state. If the record is approved, it should be officially announced sometime in the spring. To commemorate his catch, Simonds left the albie with well-known gyotaku artist, Joe Higgins of Fished Impressions (a.k.a. Joe’s Fresh Fish Prints), in Salem, MA.     A post shared by Fishprinter (@fishprinter)  In September of 2022, T. Craig of The Bronx, New York, caught a 16.2-pound, 32-inch false albacore to claim the record. However, if certified, Henry Simonds’ fish will topple the previous state record false albacore in Rhode Island by over 3 pounds and 4 inches.

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Google,"Top-secret records show New Brunswick, Alberta companies received millions in suspicious transfers"," Off the coast of Mauritania in northwest Africa, thick black smoke billowed from a massive fishing trawler, trapping the crew on a vessel operated by a Canadian shell company. It was July 19, 2019, and the Ivan Golubets, an imposing vessel comparable to the size of a soccer field, was fishing in the resource-rich waters of the western Sahara — considered a hot zone for illegal fishing by large trawlers — when tragedy struck. Oleg Niculescu, a 39-year-old married father of two, ran to the engine room to investigate the source of the fire. The burning vessel was evacuated: 59 crew members made it out, but Niculescu was never seen again. ""He was a cheerful man who loved life,"" Anna Niculescu, Oleg's wife, told a Ukrainian television station through tears. ""And in the end, everyone was saved, but he is gone."" The trawler burned for two days before sinking about 50 metres into the Atlantic Ocean while being towed by another vessel. Niculescu's remains are presumed to have sunk with the wreckage, along with evidence that might have explained what the trawler was doing for eight days before the fire, when, according to location data, its tracking system was off. ""They say he was burned to death,"" Niculescu's wife said. ""But there is no specific information — with a signature or a seal — to confirm that."" In the midst of their tragedy, Niculescu's family has spent the past year fighting for compensation from the vessel's operators.  It's a fight that's taken them to an unexpected place: Canada, where the company that operated the Ivan Golubets is registered, despite having no actual business activity in this country. Evial Business LP is registered in Calgary, and its website says it processes and sells fish from Mauritania. It has no footprint in Calgary, and Alberta corporate records leave no trace of the true beneficiaries of the company — only nominee directors in the Seychelles, a known tax haven. ""They try to hide under the umbrella of Canada's good reputation,"" said Borys Babin, an Odessa-based lawyer who has been helping Niculescu's family navigate the courts. The company appears in the FinCEN files, a 16-month-long investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), BuzzFeed News and partners. It's based on top-secret bank reports filed to the U.S. Treasury Department's intelligence unit, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network, other documents and dozens of interviews. A CBC News/Radio-Canada investigation traced the complex corporate trail and found it extends all the way from Russia to Alberta and New Brunswick, two provinces with little corporate transparency. Along the way, Canadian corporations have become caught in a story that involves allegations of insurance fraud and illegal fishing. It comes amid a global reckoning around corporate transparency and a move to force corporations to reveal who really owns and controls them, called beneficial ownership. But according to some experts, Canada and many of its provinces are moving too slowly. ""If you're a white-collar criminal and wanting to hide money, Canada is the place to go,"" said Ontario NDP MP Charlie Angus, who has studied the issue over the years. ""In fact, there's an expression that's used internationally that if you want to clean your dirty money, come to Canada. It's called 'snow washing.'"" Babin believes not only that Niculescu's death could have been prevented, but also that the sinking of the vessel amounted to fraud. He believes the ship's operators wanted to sink it in order to collect an insurance payout. A $15 million US insurance policy written by a Russian insurance company took effect mere hours before the Ivan Golubets caught fire, according to a policy reviewed by CBC News/Radio-Canada. It names Evial Business LP, the Calgary company, as one of its beneficiaries. ""They needed to have it go underwater and sink,"" Niculescu's wife told a Ukrainian television station. ""How could they not put out the fire? It's inconceivable there wasn't some sort of rescue team available to put it out, even if just to find the body. They simply let it all burn out."" The 28-year-old ship and three other vessels were together valued at a total of $16 million US in 2016, according to a Centre for Transport Strategies article. That means that the Ivan Golubets on its own would have been worth much less than the $15 million US payout. It's partly why Dyhia Belhabib also suspects insurance fraud. She is the principal investigator of fisheries for Ecotrust Canada, a Canadian charity that promotes environmental sustainability, and has written a peer-reviewed study on illegal fishing in the waters off western Sahara. ""Immediately when you said that the insurance policy was effective the same day that the vessel has sunk, I immediately thought of fraud,"" Belhabib said. CBC News/Radio-Canada reached out to Evial Business LP with a list of questions, but did not receive a response. Niculescu's family wrote to Evial Business LP a year ago to ask for compensation, but Babin said they never received a reply. Babin said he Googled Evial Business LP and was surprised to find it is a small company with no presence in Canada, given the money that would be required to operate the big trawler. A reporter who visited Evial Business LP's address at a Calgary business plaza found no trace of the company or of any fish production. Instead, they found a corporate services company that provides mail forwarding. But the company certainly has money. Documents shared with the ICIJ and other news organizations by BuzzFeed News show that the company was flagged by banks for receiving more than $4 million US through wire transfers that banks deemed suspicious. The suspicious activity reports are not proof of wrongdoing. They offer a window into how easy it is to manipulate Canada's corporate registration system. On its website, Oceanic Fisheries N.B. promises ""to make your every fish come true!"" The company advertises products like smoked and dried fish as well as ""delicious caviar, shrimps, crab sticks and sea cabbage."" But despite the initials in its corporate name, there's no evidence that Oceanic Fisheries N.B. operates in New Brunswick, a province known for its fisheries. CBC News/Radio-Canada has found that Oceanic Fisheries N.B. is linked to Evial Business LP, according to website records and confidential banking records that tie the two companies together. In 2016, Oceanic Fisheries N.B. and Evial Business LP both received transfers of large sums of money from senders that used the same Swiss bank, according to records in the FinCEN Files. The transfers typically happened within a few days of each other or sometimes even on the same day. For both Evial Business LP and Oceanic Fisheries N.B., the money ultimately landed at the same branch of a bank in Moscow. Again in 2017, both companies had a similar banking footprint. Both received big transfers — more than $640,000 US to Evial Business LP and $1 million US to Oceanic Fisheries N.B. — from the same sender, one day apart. In both cases, the money ended up at a Russian bank branch. Online records show both companies created similar-looking websites using the same registrant within weeks of each other. Both were updated on the exact same day in 2018. Despite being based in Canada, neither Oceanic Fisheries N.B. nor Evial Business LP used the Canadian banking system — a red flag for banks, according to records in the FinCEN files. In total, Oceanic Fisheries N.B. was flagged for more than $31 million US in suspicious transfers. WATCH: New Brunswick's lax corporate registration rules make it easy to conceal company identity: In September 2013, Oceanic Fisheries N.B. received two wire transfers, totalling $2.79 million US, at a bank account in Latvia.  ""Shell entities can be created and used by individuals and businesses for legitimate purposes,"" the suspicious-activity report says. ""However, they are a concern for money laundering and financial crimes given that they are easy to form, inexpensive to operate and are structured in a manner designed to conceal the transactional details of the entities."" Records from the FinCEN files indicate that Oceanic Fisheries N.B. is tied to a Latvian company called Baltreids, which does commercial fishing in Mauritania and Morocco.  When the Ivan Golubets caught fire, vessels operated by Baltreids and Oceanic Fisheries N.B. came to the rescue.  The Latvian owner of Baltreids denied having links to Evial Business LP or Oceanic Fisheries N.B. or to engaging in any illegal fishing or money laundering, in response to questions posed by CBC News/Radio-Canada and TV3 in Latvia. However, Belhabib, the fisheries investigator with Ecotrust, said she is ""100 per cent confident"" that the Ivan Golubets had ""done something shady, at least fishing where they're not supposed to fish,"" before it sank. That's based on her knowledge of illegal fishing in the region and location tracking data she reviewed for CBC News/Radio-Canada. The data shows the vessel's tracking system was off for eight days before the fire, something Belhabib found suspicious because ships are supposed to immediately go to the nearest port to fix any technical problems when a tracker stops working. With no online trace of any real connection to New Brunswick, CBC News/Radio-Canada went on a hunt to find Oceanic Fisheries N.B. On its website, Oceanic Fisheries N.B. claims it was established in the early 2000s and has spent more than 15 years ""being engaged in wholesale and retail sales of freshly frozen fish and seafood products as well as self-made fish dishes.""  But New Brunswick corporate records show the company wasn't established in the province until 2011. Its current director lists an address in South Africa, and there aren't any Canadian employees or phone numbers listed on its website. In August, a reporter visited the Saint John address that was listed on the company's website at the time. It matches a UPS store on Rothesay Avenue. The owner of the UPS Store, who bought the franchise within the last year, said she had never heard of Oceanic Fisheries N.B. Nor had the owner of the building. A day later, Oceanic Fisheries N.B. removed the Rothesay Avenue address from its website. Last year, Oceanic Fisheries N.B. changed its address on corporate records to 60 Charlotte St., in Saint John's uptown.  But when a reporter visited that address, expecting to find Oceanic Fisheries N.B., they hit another dead end. Instead of a fish production operation, there was a corporate services company, Document Searching Services, which collects mail for Oceanic Fisheries N.B. The building is also home to a large seniors' apartment complex called the Admiral Beatty. Three residents of the complex who spoke to CBC News were surprised to hear that a fish production company would claim to operate out of the same building where they live. ""I'd be shocked,"" one woman said. Oceanic Fisheries N.B. didn't respond to a list of questions from CBC News/Radio-Canada. Soon after the visit to Oceanic Fisheries N.B.'s address, a reporter got a call from a man who identified himself as Eugene Pödesberger. He said he was an assistant manager with a company called Fulcrum Office. CBC News/Radio-Canada couldn't verify the existence of that company, but Pödesberger described it as an ""agent service"" that represents Oceanic Fisheries N.B. He said he doesn't know much about Oceanic Fisheries N.B. and what they do. But Pödesberger, who was calling from a Toronto number, knew a lot about why New Brunswick is an appealing locale for international companies that otherwise have no footprint in the province: it offers cheap office space compared to major hubs like Toronto. The province also doesn't require directors of corporations to be resident Canadians — as some other provinces do — nor does it require corporations to disclose who holds beneficial ownership. Pödesberger said demand to set up businesses in New Brunswick is ""high."" But It's impossible to say exactly how high it is, since New Brunswick has a closed corporate registry. It's a problem that New Brunswick's government seems to know about. A 2015 provincial government report discussed whether the province should require companies to have at least one director who's a resident Canadian and whether it ""would lessen the potential misuse of a [New Brunswick] corporation being used as part of an international securities scam or fraud.""  But if New Brunswick changed its rules, businesses could just move to another province with lax rules, the report concluded. Across the board, Canada has ""really lax"" reporting standards for corporations, ""which is why international crime loves us,"" Angus said. But Angus said New Brunswick has ""lower than the lowest of standards."" ""This is a place where if you want to evade, say, sanctions with Russia, if you want to hide your dirty money, come to New Brunswick and set up shop,"" Angus said. When asked about the issue earlier this month, Premier Blaine Higgs indicated a willingness to explore the idea of beneficial ownership. ""If we have illegal activity or revenue being hidden or taxes being avoided that are certainly illegal in that sense, then I would want to close those loopholes and I would want to adopt the best practices,"" Higgs said. New Brunswick Green Party MLA Kevin Arseneau wants New Brunswick to develop a more transparent corporate registry. He believes the province has a moral obligation to change things. When he learned that Oceanic Fisheries N.B. was operating with New Brunswick's initials in its name and marketing itself as a New Brunswick company, he was frustrated. ""That reputation, using New Brunswick in any way, shape or form that's misleading, it shouldn't be tolerated at all,"" Arseneau said. ""This is our reputation. This is our hard work.""  With files from CBC's Terence McKenna, the ICIJ, BuzzFeed News and TV3 Latvia's Guna Gleizde Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Google,"Mobsters, Arson, and Photogrammetry: The World Record Muskie Conspiracy Theories"," Louie Spray of Wisconsin caught three world-record muskies during his time. His feat is written in stone, so it must be fact, right? If you want that rock-solid proof, visit the Greenwood Cemetery in Hayward, Wisconsin and look up the burial site for Louis Bolser Spray, Feb. 21, 1900 — Nov. 19, 1984. Then walk to Block 9 and read his granite tombstone: Spray’s biggest muskie—69 pounds, 11 ounces—holds the “All Tackle” muskellunge record in the Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame, which is also located in Hayward. The FWFHF’s record book says Spray caught the fish Oct. 20, 1949, on the 15,300-acre Chippewa Flowage15 miles east of town. Spray previously held or claimed world records for muskies in 1939 with a 59.5-pound fish and in 1940 with a 61-pound, 13-ounce fish. Records kept by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources also list Spray’s 1949 muskie as the state-record, and include its length, 63.5 inches. You won’t, however, find Spray’s name or any of his monster muskies in the International Game Fish Association’s record book. The IGFA disqualified Spray’s biggest muskie in 1992 because one of his companions, George Quentmeyer, shot it twice in the head before he, Spray and Ted Hagg hauled “Chin Whiskered Charlie” into their wooden boat. Shooting big muskies boat-side was common in northern Wisconsin until outlawed in 1966, but it violates IGFA rules for landing fish. Instead, the IGFA recognizes a Spray colleague, Cal Johnson, as its “All-Tackle” muskellunge record holder. Johnson caught his muskie—a 67.5-pounder—on July 24, 1949, three months before Spray’s big fish. He, too, was fishing near Hayward, but on the 5,139-acre Lac Courte Oreilles 16 miles southeast of town. The FWFHF recognizes Johnson’s fish as the top muskie in its “Unlimited” category of line-class divisions, meaning his line exceeded 80 pounds. Neither record-keeping organization recognizes a bigger muskie—the New York state record—a 64.5-inch fish weighing 69 pounds, 15 ounces. Arthur Lawton caught it Sept. 22, 1957, in the St. Lawrence River, the international boundary between New York state and Ontario, Canada. Lawton’s muskie stood 35 years as the undisputed world record until 1992. That’s when muskie guide and Spray biographer John Dettloff of Couderay, Wisconsin, convinced the FWFHF and IGFA that Lawton had earlier entered the same fish in another contest as a 49.5-pounder. A joint press release by the FWFHF and IGFA in August 1992 purged Lawton’s muskie from their books. The FWFHF then restored Spray’s 1949 fish as No. 1, while the IGFA eventually elevated Cal Johnson’s 1949 fish to its top spot. Those changes settled little in the muskie-hunting world. Fishing records, after all, routinely inspire doubt for countless reasons. Entries often bob and weave between conflicting state-by-state regulations and grind their gears when trying to align with the FWFHF and IGFA’s rules and categories. And unlike hunting records—which set standard minimums based on specific skull and antler measurements—fishing records include often-arcane distinctions between divisions, classifications, and “All Tackle” and “Unlimited” categories. Further, with anglers desiring recognition for myriad fish species and fishing tactics, FWFHF and IGFA records are in constant flux. To avoid unwieldly listings, both organizations follow Ricky Bobby’s credo from the movie “Talladega Nights.” That is, “If you ain’t first, you’re last.” If your fish isn’t number one in the FWFHF or IGFA’s myriad categories, it’s not listed. Therefore, you’ll find no top-10 lists or page-turning rankings of muskies, walleyes, largemouth bass, and other popular species in record books. Then again, compared to big-game record books compiled by the Boone and Crockett Club (nearly 1,000 pages with 32,000 entries) and Pope & Young Club (1,028 pages with 108,603 entries), fishing’s record books are modest. The 74-page FWFHF record book lists over 4,000 entries, and the 468-page IGFA record book lists about 350 pages of entries. Even though Spray had his feats chiseled into granite in 1984, and the FWFHF and IGFA steadfastly back Spray and Johnson, respectively, for their number one muskies, debates about their legitimacy still rage. Many muskie fanatics—be they everyday doubters, defenders, or hardcore conspiracy theorists—chase “the truth” as obsessively as history buffs probing President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. Differing opinions generally stayed civil during the early 1990s as journalists like John Husar at the Chicago Tribune and Don L. Johnson, formerly of the Milwaukee Sentinel, debated in print Dettloff’s evidence that caused the FWFHF and IGFA to disqualify Lawton’s record fish in 1992. Among other things, Dettloff presented a painstaking analysis of Lawton’s fish photo, and concluded the muskie couldn’t have exceeded 57 inches, or 7.5 inches shorter than what Lawton claimed. Dettloff also calculated that Lawton’s muskie more likely weighed about 49 pounds. Further, Lawton never presented a body. After photographing his muskie, and apparently not realizing its record potential, Lawton gave it away to be eaten. The photo he eventually submitted as evidence actually showed a muskie he caught a week earlier. But Husar considered Dettloff an “amateur” investigator and “self-proclaimed muskie historian” bent on promoting Louie Spray and muskie fishing around Hayward. Dettloff’s 2004 book Three Record Muskies in his Day reprints Spray’s book My Musky Days and supplements it with several biographical chapters about Spray.  Husar also portrayed Spray as “a dark and glowering man,” and cited reports that he was once a pistol-packing rum runner who dabbled in prostitution and worked with mobsters who frequented his Hayward casino and tavern. In a June 1991 column, Husar reported a story told by Spence Petros, then editor of Fishing Facts magazine, who said Spray bought his 1949 record muskie for $50 from Joey “The Doves” Aiuppa, the alleged head of Chicago’s crime syndicate. Aiuppa claimed he caught Spray’s muskie below the Winter Dam, which forms the Chippewa Flowage. As discussed in this article, mobsters and their bodyguards often fished illegally below the dam because the spillway teemed with big walleyes and muskies. Aiuppa told Petros he didn’t register the muskie as a record because he was “on the lam,” and couldn’t risk the publicity. Husar also considered Larry Ramsell of Hayward the “premier historian” of muskie lore, given that Ramsell co-founded the FWFHF and first published his highly detailed book “A Compendium of Muskie Angling History” in 1984. Ramsell originally defended Spray and his records, but told Husar that Spray was a “cantankerous, ornery, old goat” who was “far from honest” and “enjoyed talking about his outlaw days.” Meanwhile, Don L. Johnson (no relation to Cal Johnson) liked Spray but conceded his complexities. In his 1992 article in Wisconsin Outdoor Journal, “Louis Spray, Musky King.” Johnson wrote: “Though much maligned in life and in death, Louie Spray was in many ways an admirable man. I knew him and liked him despite his freely admitted transgressions.” Johnson first met Spray in 1951 after hiring on as the outdoor writer for the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram newspaper. Johnson approached Spray with skepticism. Johnson knew and trusted Ernie Swift, a legendary conservation warden who hounded mobsters and bootleggers during Prohibition and directed Wisconsin’s Conservation Department from 1947 to 1954. Swift considered Spray an outlaw, which led Johnson to think his investigative journalism would expose Spray and his muskie hoaxes. But as Johnson checked out the innuendo and accusations surrounding Spray, he “uncovered a lot more discrepancies in those stories” than in Spray’s. “I became convinced he had caught that (1949 record) fish,” Johnson wrote. “Maybe he hadn’t caught it exactly as described. Almost certainly he hadn’t caught it where he had said. But he’d caught it all right.” Spray said he caught the muskie on a 14-inch, live-rigged sucker that he jerked occasionally while Quentmeyer rowed. Spray said they focused their efforts on Fleming’s Bar after launching from Herman’s Landing, a nearby resort on the “Big Chip.” Spray stuck to his story, even though Tony Burmek, a local guide, said he fished that bar all day on Oct. 20, 1949 and never saw Spray and his two partners. Spray’s defenders, including Dettloff, excused him, saying anglers seldom reveal their best sites, and that Spray was merely publicizing Herman’s Landing. Johnson said he and Spray were friends by the time he left Eau Claire for the Milwaukee Sentinel in 1962. He defended Spray against accusations of insurance fraud after a fire in January 1959 destroyed Spray’s office and the skin mounts of his three “world-record” muskies, a 46.5-pound muskie from 1911, a 42-pound muskie from 1938, a 16-pound walleye, and 25-pound northern pike. Looking back in his 1992 Wisconsin Outdoor Journal article, Johnson wrote: “The three biggest muskies had been insured for $15,000 (not $25,000 as has often been reported) and could have brought more if Lou had simply offered them for sale.” Rumors that Spray torched his building and fish mounts stung him. “He wondered how anyone could think he could destroy something so dear to him,” Johnson reported. “A big part of his life, of who he was, had gone up in smoke. He suddenly looked a lot older.” Even so, Spray lived another 25 years. While battling cancer in November 1984, Spray, 84, shot himself in the head with a 16-gauge shotgun to end his suffering. When the FWFHF restored Spray’s 69-pound, 11-ounce muskie as the world record in 1992, Johnson wrote: “Wherever (Spray) was, he had to be grinning like a jack-o-lantern. He is back in the spotlight, and he has been vindicated and restored to his throne. Controversy? Lou seemed to thrive on it.”  Maybe so, but Johnson wrote those words 13 years before a group called the World Record Muskie Alliance submitted a 93-page report to the FWFHF challenging Spray’s record. The WRMA included Ramsell, the muskie historian; and famous muskie anglers like Pete Maina of Hayward and Jim Saric, editor of Musky Hunter magazine. The group’s 2005 report called Spray an “incredible cheat” whose chief talent was turning large muskies into “cold, hard cash.” The group hired a Canadian company specializing in photogrammetry to analyze photos of Spray’s record fish to determine its actual size. The technicians determined the muskie measured between 52.1 and 55.1 inches, not the recorded 63.5 inches. The DCM experts also said the muskie was 8.2 to 9.2 inches wide, dimensions that couldn’t achieve the recorded 31.25-inch girth. The technicians also analyzed photos of the muskie’s skin mount and concluded it had been “augmented” by about 14.5 inches in length and 8.51% in belly width. The report’s authors said such discrepancies proved Spray helped “perpetrate a fraud of historic proportions.” The WRMA recommended the FWFHF disqualify all Spray entries from its current and historic records. The FWFHF instead upheld Spray’s record in January 2006 and quoted three university mathematicians to justify its decision to ignore the WRMA report. The three professors—from the University of Minnesota, UM-Duluth, and Columbia University—responded with a protest letter in February 2006, stating the FWHFH did not understand their analysis. The professors recommended the Hall impanel an independent group of mathematicians and photogrammetry experts to examine all evidence. The FWHFH ignored the professors’ suggestion. When contacted by MeatEater, FWFHF executive director Emmett Brown said Spray met all requirements when submitting his muskie to recordkeepers in 1949. Brown also said the Hall did not keep a written record of its January 2006 decision rejecting the WRMA’s recommendations. Critics like Ramsell, however, questioned why the FWFHF used Dettloff’s self-taught analysis of historical photos to eliminate Lawton’s record, but rejected an analysis by photogrammetry experts to uphold Spray’s record. Ramsell resigned as the FWFHF’s world-record historian on Dec. 30, 2005, but also said he wouldn’t renew his WRMA association. He told the Chicago Sun Times: “Personal animosities got in the way of the examination of the facts. Both groups acted unprofessionally.” In June 2008, the WRMA next challenged the IGFA with a 34-page report that concluded Cal Johnson’s 67.5 pound muskie from 1949 was also a fraud. Again, the same photogrammetry specialists examined photos of the muskie and found its size exaggerated. The technicians found it measured 53.2 inches. Further, a peer review by a forensic imaging firm estimated the muskie’s maximum length at 54 inches. Both analyses fell short of the 60.25-inch length listed in affidavits for the muskie. After applying calculations to the recalibrated lengths, the WRMA found Johnson’s muskie likely weighed 25% less than its world-record listing. Given that evidence, the WRMA recommended the IGFA remove Johnson’s muskie as its all-tackle world record. As with the FWFHF, the IGFA rejected the WRMA’s report and recommendation. Cal Johnson’s muskie remains the organization’s all-tackle record holder. In a February 2009 email, the IGFA’s Jason Schratwieser told WRMA president Rich Delaney: “Your report has been vetted at the highest possible level at IGFA. We simply do not feel the photogrammetry analysis is sufficient for us to rescind this record. We are resolute in this matter.” Ramsell updated his book A Compendium of Muskie Angling History in 2007 and 2010, expressing deep regret he long supported Spray. He also wrote a scathing detailed 146-page denunciation of Spray and Cal Johnson, and those who defend them. Ramsell shares his exhaustive reports on muskie controversies here. Even so, Ramsell, Brown and others think it’s best to now leave the historical muskie records alone. “It’s hard to unring that bell,” Brown told MeatEater. “A fish is a fish whether it’s caught in 1940 or 2022. We’re satisfied our records met all criteria possible.” Agree or disagree, Spray and Johnson’s records seem intact, and the debates less dramatic. Bill Gardner of Eagan, Minnesota, wrote the 1982 fishing classic Time On the Water: One Man's Quest For the Ultimate Musky. Gardner said he’s never had strong opinions about any muskie, no matter its size, status, or who caught it. “Muskie fishing is full of Type A personalities, and that’s part of the problem,” Gardner told MeatEater. “It’s easy to find three major figures with strong opinions about any muskie and each other. You can follow whoever you want, but once they start talking, records soon get lost in the background. Many muskie fishermen simply don’t like each other.” Jordan Weeks, a fisheries biologist with the Wisconsin DNR, is a self-described member of the “muskie-fishing cult.” But he won’t choose sides. “We should just acknowledge the old records, appreciate those great fish, and move on,” Weeks said. “Do I think Louie Spray and Cal Johnson caught muskies that weighed nearly 70 pounds? It’s unlikely, but not impossible. I’m in no position 70 years later to call anyone a liar or rule on any fish. I wasn’t there. “But I know this: We don’t see muskies that big today,” Weeks continued. “The biggest I’ve seen measured 60 inches, and I’m not sure our agency has verified a 60-pounder. We’ve handled multiple 50-pounders on Green Bay, but our survey nets are too small to catch the biggest muskies. When big ones hit the sides of the net’s entry funnel, they usually back out.” Would the squabbles end if someone caught a legitimate 70-pound muskie? Maybe, but that’s unlikely. For one, many anglers won’t risk injuring a huge fish by boating and weighing it. If it died, they’d incur the wrath of all other muskie hunters. Many are more apt to grab a tape, camera, and fish cradle to document its length boat-side before turning it loose. Most likely, though, legitimate 70-pound muskies don't exist. Professor John Casselman, a legendary muskellunge and northern pike researcher at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, said muskies simply can’t grow that large. “It’s all about longevity, low fishing pressure, particle size of prey, optimum water temperatures for growth, and large, fertile waters with lots of places for muskies to lurk,” Casselman told MeatEater. “Few places have all that. For a muskie to reach 60 pounds, it needs to be in the water 32 to 35 years. That’s a lot of surviving. Catch-and-release helps more fish grow old, but even 2% mortality rates take a toll over three decades. I think we’ll see greater growth in muskies and their prey as climate change pushes water temperatures into (the high 70s) across the Great Lakes basin, but I doubt we’ll see muskies reaching weights beyond the mid- to high 60s.” Weeks agreed, saying record-book muskies will always be the exception. “We have more muskies, more muskie lakes, more muskie hatcheries, more muskie range, and more muskie-fishing opportunities than ever before, but that doesn't mean more record-book muskies,” Weeks said. “Twenty years ago in Wisconsin, our surveys found it took 100 hours to catch one 34-inch (legal) muskie. Today it takes 40 hours or less to catch one. But all muskies grow at different rates, and none live forever.” Perhaps that’s why Jim Olson, a veteran row-troller and longtime member of Muskies Inc. in Madison, Wisconsin, only sees humor in the tales and disputes about record fish. “My goal remains a 50-inch muskie,” Olson said. “I even caught one once, but it was during a tournament so they made me measure it. I’ve always said there’s two activities where a man can exaggerate by an inch, and one of them is muskie fishing. My tape said 49½  inches that day, so that’s what I told the scorekeeper. I tell everyone else it was 50 inches.” Casselman likes that approach. “It bothers me when people work so hard to prove other people wrong,” he said. “I wish they’d talk more about the great fish they caught, and work to improve their prowess. I know Louie Spray caught some beautiful fish, but I don't know enough about any of them to discuss their age, weight, or growth rates. They’re history now, and there’s probably nothing more to be learned.”",2022-06-27
Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Google,What's the world's biggest freshwater fish—and will we ever find it?," Nat Geo Explorer Zeb Hogan has spent decades asking the question. “I thought there would be a simple answer,” he now concedes, after recording a 661-pound stingray. “I was wrong.” Two decades ago, Zeb Hogan was working on Southeast Asia’s Mekong River when he got the idea for the Megafishes Project, a quest to find, study and protect the world’s largest freshwater fishes. At the heart of the project was the question: Which species is the largest? “I thought there would be a simple answer,” says Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. “I was wrong.” For years, he scoured Earth’s waterways, often as the host of Nat Geo Wild’s “Monster Fish” show. Although he came close on many occasions, he could not find a fish with a verified weight greater than a 646-pound Mekong giant catfish caught in Thailand in 2005, a catch that had sparked his search. Instead, Hogan found that river giants around the world were often poorly studied and in most cases in serious decline, with some species about to go extinct. (Read more about how scientists are saving megafishes.) Eventually he and I began writing a book, Chasing Giants: In Search of the World’s Largest Freshwater Fish, published this month by University of Nevada Press. But even after finishing the manuscript last year, he still did not have an answer to the central question. Then, miraculously, Hogan’s research team in Cambodia got a call from fishers who said they had caught a giant freshwater stingray in the Mekong River, much bigger than ones previously caught. The ray, as it turned out, measured 13 feet long and weighed 661 pounds, which Guinness World Records recognized as the largest-ever recorded freshwater fish in 2022. The discovery energized conservation efforts to protect these behemoths. Unlike the catfish that was killed and sold for meat in 2005, the stingray caught last year was released alive after being fitted with an acoustic receiver. This has allowed researchers to track its movements to learn more about a species they knew next to nothing about. “We’ve been losing these fish without truly knowing them,” Hogan says. “Now we have the tools to study and protect these amazing creatures, so we need to take that newfound knowledge and turn it into meaningful protection. It’s not too late, the big fish are still out there.” Ages 7-12 And Hogan says he’s still on the hunt—for a fish even heavier than the giant stingray. For his project, which was supported by the National Geographic Society, Hogan identified more than two dozen species under the term “megafishes,” freshwater fish that could grow at least six feet long or reach weights of 200 pounds. These fish are a diverse assemblage of creatures of different shapes and life histories, from colossal carps and catfish to electric eels and gargantuan gars. What they have in common, besides their huge size, is that many of their populations have been decimated by overfishing, dam building, pollution, invasive species, and climate change. The Chinese paddlefish, which could grow over 20 feet long, was declared extinct during the early stages of Hogan’s search. “The realization that these fish, some of which have been on Earth for hundreds of millions of years, were disappearing in our lifetime was incredibly disturbing,” he says. Giant fish are indicators of river health, so their decline is a worrying sign for the world’s freshwater ecosystems, which studies show are often more degraded than their marine and terrestrial counterparts. Having focused on the Mekong giant catfish early in his career, Hogan came to suspect that the species, along with the world’s largest carp, the giant barb, had more or less disappeared in the Mekong River. Other possible contenders for biggest fish included the air-breathing arapaima, which dwells in South America’s Amazon Basin, and the wels catfish, Europe’s largest freshwater fish and a species with a voracious appetite. Emerging as the top contender for the title, however, was the giant freshwater stingray that is found in rivers in Southeast Asia, where most of its populations are endangered but may still be doing better than many other giant fish species. For several years, Hogan focused his search on the Mae Klong River in central Thailand, not far from Bangkok, where sport fishers were catching and releasing enormous rays. During a “Monster Fish” shoot, Hogan’s team caught a stingray that he believed was of record-breaking size, but the team did not have a scale large enough to weigh the massive animal. Hogan suspected, however, that the Mekong River in Cambodia also held record rays. The USAID research project he’s been leading since 2017, Wonders of the Mekong, has increasingly focused on a biologically rich stretch of the river in northern Cambodia, where deep pools are believed to be a refuge for many large fish. (Read about a 13-foot-wide stingray found in a deep hole in the Mekong.) Fishers told Hogan they regularly caught stingrays weighing as much as a thousand pounds, but those accounts were difficult to verify.  As it happened, a team of American scientists were in the area at the time to set up a first-ever telemetry study in northern Cambodia to learn more about migration patterns and behavior of the fish in the Mekong River system. The standout female became the first fish to be implanted with an acoustic tag for the study.  Hydrophone records showed the tagged stingray stayed almost exclusively in the specific area of the river where she was discovered. This means a place-based management approach, such as setting up a no-fishing reserve in the area, would help protect the stingrays. Such reserves are common in Southeast Asia, though they require strong buy-in from local communities.  “We plan to extend our work more in creating public awareness and local participation to protect these species, including the stingray,” says Heng Kong, director of the Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute of the Cambodian Fisheries Administration. For Hogan, the search for the largest freshwater fish is not over. “This ray is likely not the biggest individual stingray that exists in the river,” he says. “Fishers tell me all the time they’ve caught bigger rays than this.” There are some experts who suggest that other species, in particular the arapaima, may reach similar weights as the stingray. Scientists studying growth ring deposition on the scales of arapaimas living in Guyana’s Essequibo River have shown those animals may grow much heavier than those from central Brazil. (Read about a new arapaima species identified in 2016.) For instance, the length-mass relationship developed by the scientists suggests that an arapaima caught a couple of years ago in Brazil, which measured about 10 feet and weighed 540 pounds, would have weighed over 700 pounds in Guyana had it been of similar length. “I predict the ultimate world record arapaima will come from Guyana,” Donald Stewart, a fisheries professor at State University of New York, who led the research, said by email. Hogan says his search was always about more than just finding the biggest fish. “It was always about learning more about these animals,” he says. “Finding this record ray is proof and evidence that these fish are still out there, and that’s a positive sign, but we’ve just scratched the surface when it comes to our knowledge about them.” Copyright © 1996-2015 National Geographic SocietyCopyright © 2015-2024 National Geographic Partners, LLC.

NOAA Forecasts Above-Average Summer ‘Dead Zone’ in Gulf of Mexico A team of scientists, including a University of Michigan aquatic ecologist, is forecasting an above-average summer “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico covering about 5,827 square miles—an area roughly the size of Connecticut. This summer‘s dead zone is about 12% higher than the average dead zone measurement over the 37-year period of record. The dead zone, or hypoxic area, is an area of low oxygen that can kill fish and othermarine life. It occurs every summer and is primarily a result of excess... California: Bay Area Man Sues Red Lobster, Claims Labor Law Violation A former Red Lobster worker in the Bay Area is leading a proposed class-action lawsuit against the bankrupt seafood chain, alleging it violated fair warning laws in the sudden shuttering of several locations.

COMMENTARY: The Warming Ocean is Leaving Coastal Economies in Hot Water Ocean-related tourism and recreation supports more than 320,000 jobs and US$13.5 billion in goods and services in Florida. But a swim in the ocean became much less attractive in the summer of 2023, when the water temperatures off Miami reached as high as 101 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius).

Vietnam: Shrimp Exports Likely to Maintain Growth Momentum Vietnamese shrimp exports between the beginning of the year and mid-May surged by 8.3% to reach US$1.1 billion against the same period from last year, according to data released by the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP). Specifically, Vietnamese shrimp exports to the EU market during the reviewed period reached US$134 million, up 1.2% on-year. Meanwhile, the country grossed US$161 million from exports to Japanese market, posting a slight annual fall of 3%... Skretting Looks to Precision Nutrition for Environmental Gain Skretting has introduced AmiNova, a feed formulation aimed at reducing the environmental impact of aquaculture. The company looked to enhance precision in fish nutrition by focusing on an ideal digestible amino acid profile rather than just crude or digestible protein. “Traditionally, aquaculture feeds have been based on crude protein, and later, on digestible protein,” explained May Helen Holme, innovation director for salmon at Skretting. “With AmiNova, we evaluate the total amino acid levels ingested by fish, eliminating unnecessary excess and meeting nutritional needs with greater precision and... Vietnam: Quang Ninh Strives to Become Northern Region's Marine Aquaculture Hub The northeastern province of Quang Ninh aims to become a fisheries hub in the northern region by 2030.

Norway Revokes All Snow Crab Permits In Effort To Ensure Better Profitability In Fishery The Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries confirmed earlier this month that all snow crab permits have been revoked, according to a new royal decree. The government agency further explained that “this means that all permits will be deleted from the Directorate of Fisheries’ registers with effect from January 1, 2025.” Restrictions on snow crab participation have been looming since the Ministry of Trade and Fisheries released its 2024 quota announcement in December. At the time, the government had acknowledged that they would be limiting participation beginning...

Fishing Tactics in African Waters Put Under Scrutiny A new Chinese fishing port on Tanzania's Indian Ocean ­coastline that is expected to create thousands of jobs is on track to be completed next year. The US$111 million port in Kilwa Masoko is being built by state-owned China Harbour Engineering Company under the Belt and Road Initiative, a ­transcontinental infrastructure project, with the aim of helping China meet its huge domestic demand for seafood. But the means by which it meets this demand have come under scrutiny with critics warning that Chinese fleets are putting supplies at... Vietnam: Quang Tri Focuses on Monitoring Origin of Fishing Products at Ports The central province of Quang Tri has been concentrating on monitoring the origin of fishing products at ports, as part of its efforts to wipe out illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. To facilitate the work, the province's sub-department of fisheries applied the electronic catch documentation and traceability system (eCDT). This application monitors and ensures transparency and legality in line with regulations on certifying the origin of domestic fishing to satisfy the requirements of the European Commission. eCDT is a smartphone app shared by... Move to Gut Fisheries Law Could Sink Thai Exports and Poor Fishermen, Critics Warn Concern is growing that Thailand’s new fisheries law will drag the country backwards, making it more vulnerable to human trafficking and jeopardising its multibillion-baht seafood export industry. “If Thailand’s ranking in the US State Department’s Trafficking in Persons [TIP] Report slips to Tier 3, it is going to be difficult to climb back up,” said Thanaporn Sriyakul, director of the Institute of Politics and Policy Analysis.

ANALYSIS: Increasing Freight Drives Pressure on Value Finfish  The frozen fillet market for tilapia, pangasius, and catfish is experiencing shifts due to a variety of factors impacting both supply and demand.

Ottawa Set to Stop Open-Net Salmon Farms in B.C., Giving the Industry 5 Years to Transition The Liberal government intends to move ahead with its 2019 campaign commitment to put an end to open-net salmon fish farms in coastal B.C. waters but the industry has been given five years to adapt to the plan, three sources say.

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Bing,Record-breaking white perch caught in Pennsylvania: See what it weighed in at," A Berks County angler has broken the record for a white perch in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission (PFBC) announced the new state record Friday caught by Christopher Barrett, 19, of Mohnton. The agency reports Barrett was fishing April 14 with his father Craig near the Commodore Barry Bridge over the Delaware River in Chester, Delaware County. They were using heavy duty spinning rods fitted with fish finder rigs and circle hooks baited with bloodworms to target striped bass and catfish but were also catching white perch. At around 11 a.m., Barrett reeled in a particularly large perch that caught the attention of both anglers. ""We usually keep a few perch to eat, and when I went to put that one in the cooler, we both said that’s got to be the biggest white perch we’ve ever seen,""  Barrett said in a news release.  ""When we got back to the dock, my dad looked up the state record for Pennsylvania, which was under two pounds. We weighed the fish on our own scale, and it was 2 pounds, 3 ounces. So, we started to get really excited at that point.” More:Pennsylvania fisherman catches yellow perch that’s comparable to the state record Waterways conservation officer Derek Norman met the angler at the Bowmansville Post Office where a certified scale was located. With the WCO present, the white perch officially tipped the scales at 2 pounds, 1 ounce, exceeding the previous state record, also caught in the Delaware River in 2008, by five ounces.   While only weight is considered for state record certification in Pennsylvania, the fish measured 14.125 inches long with a girth of 12.25 inches. An inspection of the fish was also conducted, including an examination of the contents of its stomach, which appeared normal for a large female. “It was a large fish to begin with and it was full of eggs, which made it even heavier,” Barrett told the PFBC. “We’re pretty good at catching perch, so I guess it was a little bit of skill and luck combined with good timing to catch that fish at just the right time.” In addition to recording the certified weight and the in-person inspection by Norman, Barrett completed a state record fish application which included color photographs and detailed information about the catch, which was reviewed by the PFBC Division of Fisheries Management and confirmed. Barrett plans to give the fish to a taxidermist to preserve the memory of the catch. A list of current Pennsylvania State Record Fish, official rules and application can be found at Fishandboat.com. ""I’m so grateful for this record, but even more excited that I got to share this experience with my dad,"" Barrett told the agency. ""We go fishing all the time together and it’s our favorite thing in the world to do.  We’ll never forget this."" Brian Whipkey is the outdoors columnist for USA TODAY Network sites in Pennsylvania.

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Bing,Is vessel size a factor in collapsed container stacks?," Seatrade Maritime is part of the Informa Markets Division of Informa PLC This site is operated by a business or businesses owned by Informa PLC and all copyright resides with them. Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726.  See All Event Coverage » Marcus Hand | Dec 07, 2020 But it is not the only example of collapsed container stacks and boxes lost overboard this year including sister vessel ONE Aquila a month earlier, also on the transpacific trade, and the APL England off Australia in May. These and other incidents beg the question of whether incidents are becoming more frequent and if the size of vessels, which has increased dramatically in recent years, is a factor. Seatrade Maritime News asked Capt Yves Vandenborn, director of loss prevention for The Standard Club, if there was a trend of increasing incidents. “There has been a recent spike of incidents with containers lost overboard. There is also an enhanced focus from various maritime states who have increased the fines on shipping companies, plus the increased cost of cleaning up the containers. That said, we would need to look at statistics in more depth to see if there is a continued increasing trend over the years,” he explained. Related: Storm damaged containership ONE Apus headed for Kobe  The question of the size and scale of the vessel sees a number of different factors come into play, although the basic equipment, technology and application in terms of securing the containers remains the same regardless of the vessel’s size. Marine consultants and surveyors Brookes Bell commented: “It should be noted that the inherent strength of a container stack relies on multiple factors, such as the design load of the Class approved lashing equipment, the physical condition of the lashing equipment, the correct application of the lashing equipment, the physical condition of the containers and the correct stowage in accordance with correct declared container weights. These factors affect all container vessels, irrespective of the size.” Related: ONE Aquila diverted after container collapse in bad weather The consultant added: “Where the containers carried are in a physically sound condition, with accurate declared weights, properly loaded in accordance with the Cargo Securing Manual, secured in accordance with the Cargo Securing Manual with sound lashing equipment (and deck fittings), and the forces acting on the lashing equipment are within the lashing equipment design loads, the size of the vessel, and number of containers carried, should be immaterial.” When it comes to large vessels Capt Vandenborn of the Standard Club noted the quick turnaround required for such ships with three, four or five gantry cranes working simultaneously. “The fitting of the twistlocks on the containers is done by the stevedores ashore, and the crane operator places the container on the deck stack. The success of a safe stack on deck largely depends on the twistlocks & other lashing equipment operating correctly once they are placed within the stack,” he said. “In addition we have seen that not all ports adhere to the VGM regulations, resulting in heavy containers ending up high in the stack. This may not always be noticed by the crew or chief officer.” The Standard Club also considered whether the sheer size of very and ultra large containerships contributes to the motion and rolling of the vessel in severe weather, creating greater risk of container stacks collapsing. “On very/ultra large container Post-Panamax vessels, the large beams result in an unavoidable, relatively large GM. This in turn leads to the vessel being very stable and therefore stiff which could lead to violent rolling motions and accelerations when the weather deteriorates,” Capt Vandenborn said. Tight operating schedules on the container liner trades and powerful engines that enable speed to be maintained even during bad weather can also play a factor. “The consequence is that, at times, container ships can be driven hard. When ships are driven hard in bad weather, the loads on the lashing gear can be severe,” he said. “Moreover as a consequence of ship motions - a complex interplay of accelerations and forces will affect the ship and cargo. The stacks of individual containers experience lateral and vertical forces. In addition, in the event of large motions, these stacks can clash into each other. “As a result, an entire stack of containers could fall over, which could then fall overboard or fall against another stack of containers. Stack collapses due to clashing are often progressive in that when one stack begins knocking into adjacent ones, the forces are much higher. “A further concern for these large ships is synchronous rolling, causing the vessel to exceed the container securing arrangement designed roll angle,” Capt Vandenborn said.

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Bing,The Biggest Fish Ever Caught," 
By Dac Collins
 Updated on Jun 10, 2024 6:13 PM EDT 12 minute read We may never really know precisely what the biggest fish ever caught was — or who caught it, or where. The world’s waters are deep and mysterious places, and the best fishermen are good at keeping secrets. That’s just one reason why any modern list of the world’s biggest catches includes some caveats. If we’re basing this list off size alone, we’d have to consider the 2-ton whale shark that Chinese commercial fishermen reportedly netted by accident in 2014. But then we’d also have to include the 661-pound giant stingray that some angler-researchers tagged in Cambodia in 2023, and which edged out the previous Guinness World Record for the largest freshwater fish ever caught. There are also plenty of huge fish that have been caught illegally and kept a secret, or caught and released and never recognized. (More on this in a minute.) So, for the sake of keeping things simple, our official list of the biggest fish ever caught will only include world-record sportfish that were caught with a rod-and-reel and certified by the International Game Fish Association. These are fish caught by just one angler, who followed all the universally-agreed upon fishing rules, and who took the time to submit their catches to the organization for record-book consideration. In addition to listing the five biggest fish of all time, all of which were reeled in from the ocean, we’ll also look at the biggest freshwater fish ever caught. Finally, we’ll round out the list of the biggest fish ever caught with a few honorable mentions, including some of the most highly-prized game fish species in North America. The IGFA has been keeping track of the world’s sportfishing records since it was founded in 1939. Its record book is constantly updated and contains nearly every species of sportfish ever hooked on planet Earth. The IGFA recognizes line-class records, which are based on the breaking strength of the fishing line used, along with catch-and-release records, in which fish are measured by length and must be released alive. Then there’s the holy grail of traditional fishing records: the all-tackle world records, which honor the heaviest fish ever caught with a rod-and-reel. To be considered in this category, all potential record fish must be weighed on a certified scale, and they’re often killed in the process. This is where record-keeping gets a bit complicated, as some anglers today would rather release their fish of a lifetime than be remembered for killing it. Take Captain Chip Michalove, for example. In 2022 he caught and released a giant hammerhead shark off the coast of South Carolina. It would have easily crushed the state record, and it very well could have beat out the all-tackle world record caught 16 years prior, but he didn’t care about either. Photograph courtesy of Scott Enloe Then there’s Scott Enloe, the Colorado angler who caught and released the new state-record lake trout in 2023 while fishing with his son on Blue Mesa Reservoir. His laker also outweighed the all-tackle world record by roughly a pound, according to his hand scale. But since confirming the weight would have meant killing the fish (it wouldn’t fit in his live well), he chose to photograph and release it instead. Enloe told Outdoor Life in May that he would try to get the fish certified by the IGFA as an all-tackle world record anyway, but it still hasn’t been accepted. “I could have made it easy to put in the [IGFA] book, but I would have had to kill it, and I was not going to kill that fish,” Enloe said. “I would love to have the world record, and it is the world record. But if we don’t get it … I know what I caught, my son knows what I caught, and I’m okay with that.” Read Next: Are Record Fish Stories as Captivating as They Used to Be? So, as you read the following entries, just keep in mind that some of the biggest fish ever caught got away from the record books, making them difficult to track accurately here. Looking specifically at the IGFA’s list of all-tackle world records, the biggest fish ever caught (by far) was a great white shark. Rounding out the Top 5 are four other saltwater species that all topped 1,000 pounds. No. 4 and No. 5 also happen to be two of the world’s most sought-after saltwater game fish, while sharks occupy the other top spots. Photo courtesy IGFA True giants of the deep, bluefin tuna are sleek, fast, and powerful. Speaking from experience, they fight harder than just about any other fish in the ocean. Their meat is also one of the most sought-after delicacies in the sushi world, giving them the rare distinction of being the most expensive edible fish on Earth. In 2019, a 613-pounder caught in Japan sold for $3.1 million at auction.   The largest bluefin tuna ever caught, according to the IGFA record book, weighed more than twice that. Caught by Ken Fraser in Nova Scotia waters in 1979, it tipped the scales at 1,496 pounds. Photo courtesy IGFA Marlin have everything you’d ever want in a game fish. They grow huge and fight like hell. They’re also a feast for the eyes with their beautifully-colored sides and pointed bills. Black marlin are the largest species in the marlin family. (Blue marlin are a close second, coming in just behind bluefin tuna at No. 6 in the IGFA’s book.)  The biggest black marlin ever caught is also the fourth heaviest fish ever caught, according to the IGFA. It weighed 1,560 pounds and was caught in Cabo Blanco, Peru, in 1953 by Alfred Glassell Jr.   Photo courtesy IGFA Coming in at No. 3 on the list is a Greenland shark, a lesser-known species that lives in the Arctic Ocean and is rarely seen by most anglers. These sharks are also the longest-living vertebrates in the world, reaching ages between 250 and 500 years old.  The all-tackle world record Greenland shark was caught in Norway in 1987 by Terje Nordtvedt. The shark ate a herring fished on the bottom, and it tipped the scales at 1,708 pounds 9 ounces. Photo courtesy IGFA The second largest fish ever caught and certified by the IGFA is a tiger shark. Along with great white sharks and bull sharks, this species rounds out what some call the “Big Three” — the three shark species most likely to attack a human.  The all-tackle world record tiger shark weighed 1,785 pounds 11 ounces. It was caught in Australian waters in 2004 by Kevin James Clapson. Photo courtesy IGFA The biggest great white shark ever caught weighed 2,664 pounds and was landed off Australia’s southern coast in 1959. Alfred Dean reeled in the monster shark on 130-pound test. He used a porpoise for bait.  This is also one of the more interesting fishing records for the simple fact that it will likely never be broken — at least, not anytime soon. Great white sharks are now a protected species in most of the world’s oceans. They’re federally protected in U.S. waters, and it’s illegal to harvest them in many other places as well, which means they’re no longer accepted by the IGFA as potential world-record fish. You also can’t get away with using porpoises or dolphins for bait these days, as it’s against the law in both U.S. and Australian waters to catch, kill, or otherwise harass these species. Giant stingrays aside, the biggest freshwater fish ever caught, according to the Guinness Book of World Records, was a 646-pound Mekong giant catfish. A team of fisherman in Thailand landed the fish after an hour-long battle, according to National Geographic. And although they tried to keep it alive, it died and was eaten by local villagers. Since the IGFA doesn’t recognize fish that were landed by multiple anglers (the rules dictate that only one person can touch the rod during the battle), we’ll move down the list to another giant catfish species that’s native to Europe and Asia. The largest freshwater catfish ever caught on a rod-and-reel and certified by the IGFA was a 297-pound 9-ounce Wels catfish. European angler Attila Zsedely caught the all-tackle world record Wels from Italy’s River Po in 2010. In 2023, Italian angler Alessandro Biancardi caught and released a massive Wels catfish from the same river that was bigger, lengthwise, than Zsedely’s fish. Biancardi’s fish measured 285 centimeters, while Zsedley’s measured 245 centimeters. This has led some to speculate that Biancardi’s catfish could have weighed upward of 300 pounds, which would have easily replaced Zsedeley’s record. But since Biancardi released the fish alive instead of bringing it to a certified scale, we’ll never know for sure. Some of the other biggest record catfish from around the world include another Mekong giant catfish that was caught in Thailand in 2010 and was later certified by the IGFA. That fish weighed 260 pounds.  The biggest record catfish ever caught in North America was a blue catfish that weighed 143 pounds. Richard Nicholas Anderson caught the big blue cat in 2011 while fishing Kerr Lake in Virginia.  We couldn’t make a proper list of the biggest fish ever caught without including a few of North America’s most beloved game fish. Starting with the biggest species, we’ll work our way from giant sturgeon down to black bass. The white sturgeon occupies a unique place on this list because it’s an anadromous fish that lives in both salt- and freshwater. Along with the eight other members of the sturgeon family, these ancient fish are true dinosaurs. Scientists believe they’ve been around for about 200 million years. However, many of these species are now considered endangered due to overfishing for the caviar trade. White sturgeon are the largest species in this family, and they’re faring a little better than some of their cousins. They can still be caught in some larger rivers on the West Coast (including the Snake and Columbia Rivers), but they must be released alive. Which means the all-tackle world record for the species should stand for some time. That record sturgeon weighed 468 pounds, and was caught in a California bay in 1983. Another living dinosaur, alligator gar are a prehistoric species and the largest members of the gar family. Until fairly recently, these toothy critters were vilified by anglers as a trash fish that ate more desirable game fish like bass and crappie. Because of this negative perception — one that fisheries biologists have now debunked — they were killed throughout their native range and even eradicated from some areas. This attitude has come full circle, with anglers now targeting these freshwater giants in Texas and other parts of the South as gamefish in their own right. The all-tackle world record alligator gar was caught in the Lone Star State in September 2023; it weighed 283 pounds. Amazingly, the angler who reeled in the world-record fish did so using 6-pound test.   Known as “the fish of 10,000 casts,” muskellunge (better known as muskies) are notoriously difficult to hook and land, which makes them one of the most prized sportfish on the continent. Muskies are the largest members of the Esox family, which includes pike and pickerel. The all-tackle world record muskie was caught in Wisconsin’s Lake Court Oreilles back in 1949. It weighed 67 pounds 8 ounces and ate a hard-bodied crankbait.       Photo courtesy IGFA Chinook (or king) salmon are the largest of the world’s salmonids. Like sturgeon, these are anadromous fish that are born in the river, go out to sea, and return to the river to spawn. Sadly, this noble, ocean-going species is on the decline throughout its native range, with many runs listed as threatened or endangered. The all-tackle world record Chinook salmon came from the Kenai River in Alaska, and it weighed 97 pounds 4 ounces. Angler Les Anderson caught the fish drifting a spin-n-glo. North American anglers love catching trout, and the continent is now home to more than a dozen species, subspecies, and hybrids. This includes native fish like cutthroat and rainbow trout, along with the European brown trout that were introduced here during the late 19th century. The largest of these species is the lake trout, which, like brook trout, are technically in the char family. Because of their gargantuan size, “lakers” have been widely introduced outside of their native range — which includes Canada, Alaska, the Great Lakes, and New England. The all-tackle world-record laker, according to IGFA, weighed 72 pounds and was caught in Canada’s Northwest Territories. As mentioned above, there’s a good chance that bigger lakers have been caught but never recognized by the organization. Photo courtesy IGFA Far surpassing trout in terms of overall popularity, largemouth bass are widely considered North America’s favorite gamefish. The biggest member of the black bass family, largemouths have been stocked by fish and game agencies across the country, and they can now be caught in pretty much every U.S. state outside of Alaska. Not surprisingly due to their popularity, the largemouth bass record is one of the most coveted records in the angling world. The IGFA currently lists two bucketmouths as tied for the No. 1 spot, and they each weighed 22 pounds 4 ounces. The first world record was caught by George Perry in Georgia’s Montgomery Lake back in 1932, but that’s about all we know about it. Very few details exist about Perry’s catch and there are no known photos of the fish. The more recent world record was caught from a lake in Japan in 2009 by Manabu Kurita. Read Next: The Best Bass Lures Striped bass are another beloved bass species that are targeted by saltwater anglers up and down the East Coast. There are also healthy populations of landlocked stripers in the U.S., but they don’t grow quite as large as their saltwater counterparts. The world-record striped bass was caught in Long Island Sound in 2011. It weighed 81 pounds 14 ounces. It depends on how we define the word “strongest.” It’s also fairly subjective. But if you were to take a survey among the saltwater anglers who regularly target some of the biggest fish in the ocean, most of them would probably say bluefin tuna. These fish have a reputation for making deep, blistering runs that’ll wear out even the toughest of anglers. This is another question that could generate a never-ending debate among anglers. When it comes to fishing in freshwater, steelhead (a rainbow trout that runs to the ocean and back) and muskies are some of the most difficult fish to catch. A list of the hardest fish to catch in saltwater would likely include marlin, sailfish, and other members of the billfish family, along with permit and Giant Trevally. The biggest fish species on planet Earth is the whale shark. They can grow up to 40 feet long and weigh up to 40 tons, according to NOAA, and they’re protected in many countries. They’re classified as fish and not whales, but like many whale species, whale sharks are filter feeders that eat plankton, krill, and other small organisms. This means it’s almost impossible to catch them with a rod-and-reel, although they’re occasionally caught on accident by commercial fishermen using gill nets.  There is no such thing. The only fish that’s impossible to catch is the one you never cast to. (AFTCO, via Facebook) The biggest fish ever caught on a rod-and-reel and certified by the IGFA is a huge great white shark that was caught in Australia and weighed more than 2,000 pounds. Every other fish in the Top Five came from the ocean as well.  There have also been plenty of big fish pulled from freshwater lakes and rivers around the world. The biggest of these are all catfish, and some of the catfish species native to Europe and Asia far outweigh the big blue cats and giant flatheads that we catch here in North America. One of the best things about fishing records, however, is that they’re constantly being broken. Which means the biggest fish in the world is still out there somewhere.  Summary News Editor

Vessel caught with inaccurate fish size records,Bing,How do I stop fish falling off the skewer?," I must be buying the wrong fish.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,Galápagos – the best example of marine protection in action," The Galápagos can be described as the real-life equivalent of a place that should only exist in mythology books. It’s a paradise where ancient giant tortoises wander around and exotic creatures, like Marine Iguanas, dive into the surf to scour the ocean floor for food. It’s the birthplace of the theory of evolution and the first stop on our brand-new ship tour.  We’re visiting this wonder of the world to showcase the success of the Galápagos Marine Reserve – one of the best examples of ocean protection in action. The Ecuadorian government created this marine protected area that covers approximately 133,000 km2 in 1998. This ocean refuge is teeming with thousands of species of marine life, from mammoth whale sharks and green turtles to scalloped hammerhead sharks and playful fur seals.  An overwhelming number of fish, like the King Angelfish, Parrot Fish and Sun Fish, transform the ocean water into an explosion of colour. We intend to capture and share all these unforgettable sights.  Unfortunately, there is also a flipside to our expedition. We’ll be visiting a vast ocean area that’s part of an underwater superhighway species use to migrate through the Galápagos region. Outside the marine reserve, the ocean remains unprotected and open to industrial fishing vessels that devastate precious and often endangered marine life. The pressure of overfishing outside the reserve could also have dire consequences for life in the reserve.   That’s why this area, located between the national waters of Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama, urgently needs protection. These governments have already taken some concrete steps to protect their coastal waters, and they now have a unique opportunity to protect this pocket of international waters, closing it off to industrial fishing fleets.  To strengthen our case for a new protected area, onboard scientists will conduct research studies from the ship, including eDNA tests. This sounds complicated, but really isn’t. Organisms living in the water shed cells containing genetic material. When the water is collected and analysed, the data can be used to measure the richness of biodiversity within a specific area. The eDNA data gathered from inside and outside the reserve can serve as further evidence to support creating a new and larger marine protected area. Last year, the historic Global Ocean Treaty was approved, a tool that governments can use to create a new protected area on the high seas. But they first need to sign the Treaty into law. Creating this new safe haven can be a great step towards ensuring that 30% of the oceans are protected by 2030. The Galápagos inspired the theory that connects all life on Earth. Imagine what the global ocean, covered in protected areas, could inspire.  Call on the Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters to create new global ocean sanctuaries and protect our blue planet.",2024-03-01
Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,"5 Chinese fishing boats seized, 1 arrested for illegal fishing"," All Headlines North Korea Sports Top News Most Viewed Korean Newspaper Headlines Today in Korean History Yonhap News Summary Editorials from Korean Dailies URL is copied.  INCHEON, April 2 (Yonhap) -- The Coast Guard has seized five Chinese fishing boats operating illegally in South Korean-controlled waters off the west and southern coasts, and confiscated one of them, officials said Tuesday.  The fishing boats were caught during a joint crackdown by the Coast Guard, the Navy and the fisheries ministry in waters near the western inter-Korean sea border and the exclusive economic zone around the southern island of Jeju between May 25-31, officials said.  One Chinese captain has been formally arrested and five crew members were expelled, while 58 other boats have been evicted, officials said. A total of 450 million won (US$332,690) has been collected as collateral from the seized fishing boats, they said.  During the crackdown, a series of Chinese sailors were caught violating the Northern Limit Line (NLL), the de-facto inter-Korean maritime border in the Yellow Sea in small rubber boats, and some Chinese vessels were accused of underreporting their fish catches.  In one instance, a Chinese vessel with 31 illegal fishing nets that scoops up even small fish was caught in waters off Jeju, authorities said.   The average number of illegal Chinese fishing boats has shrunk to 140 ships daily during the March crackdown, as opposed to some 300 ships regularly detected each year, according to the Coast Guard.   ""We will sternly clamp down on illegal fishing that devastates the fishing grounds by sweeping up all things down to small fry,"" said a Coast Guard official, vowing to deploy additional 500-ton guard ships in the NLL area in the Yellow Sea. This photo, provided by the Korea Coast Guard, shows the illegal fishing nets confiscated during a crackdown in waters near the inter-Korean sea border in the Yellow Sea and the exclusive economic zone around the southern island of Jeju.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,Seabirds and protected marine species caught by commercial fishers | NZ Government," Sometimes birds, sea mammals, and other marine life accidentally get caught during commercial fishing. Commercial fishers have to file daily reports about what they have caught. We release these reports quarterly. Fisheries New Zealand supports transparent reporting. Every 3 months, we release information gathered from the daily self-reports from commercial fishers. These reports tell us about their catches – the species, the fishing methods they were using, and where they were fishing. Commercial fishers also have to tell us about accidental catches of marine mammals (like seals and dolphins), seabirds, reptiles, protected fish, and corals, sponges, and bryozoans. We use these quarterly reports to monitor trends throughout the year. On-board cameras went live on set net vessels greater than or equal to 8 metres in overall length and trawl vessels less than or equal to 32 metres in overall length fishing off the north, east and south coasts of the South Island on 31 October 2023. Experience overseas and in New Zealand is that monitoring of fishing by fisheries observers or cameras will generally lead to more accurate reporting. Prior to onboard cameras, Fisheries New Zealand relied on data collected by observers to estimate total captures and risk to protected species from commercial fishing. The increased reporting after the rollout of cameras remains in line with these estimates and will continue to be monitored as more data becomes available. Future research will use data from cameras to update risk and capture estimates to ensure that these are based on the best available information. The data in these quarterly reports is largely unchanged from the information entered at sea by fishers. In some cases, Fisheries New Zealand has also had to make assumptions about the likeliest fishing methods. It has not been independently verified. That means it's possible that some species have been incorrectly identified. Or there may be some other reporting errors. Consequently, this information should not be seen as an alternative to other reports such as the Fisheries New Zealand seabird risk assessment reports. Those are peer-reviewed and are underpinned by a robust analytical methodology. The information in these quarterly reports also differs from the data presented on the website, Protected species by-catch. Information on that website is based on Fisheries New Zealand's observer-collected data. That data is checked for errors and the species verified before it's published. Occasionally birds collide with, or land on a vessel or its superstructure. Sometimes the birds are injured or disoriented and unable to fly away without help. This is called a deck strike. Fishers are required to report deck strikes as outlined in Part 3 of the Fisheries (E-logbook Users Instructions and Codes) Circular 2021. Deck strikes are not considered to be fishing-related captures, however they are included in the seabird data published here.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,"Major halibut fishing investigation leads to dozens of charges, catch seizures"," A ""major case"" investigation into illegal halibut fishing in the Sambro area of Nova Scotia has led to dozens of fishery violation charges and the seizure of a long-line fishing boat, cash and halibut worth $40,000. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans said in a statement Tuesday that 66 charges related to the illegal possession and sale of harvested halibut have been laid in court on two occasions. In total eight people and five companies are accused of multiple offences including offload without a monitor, inaccurate hail, inaccurate logbook, possession of undersized halibut, providing false statements to a fishery officer and fishing without authorization. The companies charged are Sambro-based A.L.S. Fisheries, Law Fisheries, Starfish Fisheries, Bedford-based XLZ Holdings and Starfish Licences. ""Fisheries and Oceans Canada has a mandate to protect and conserve marine resources and to prosecute offenders under the Fisheries Act,"" the department said in a release issued Tuesday. The operation goes back two years but was only revealed this week after 41 charges were laid on Dec. 13 in Halifax provincial court. The accused are scheduled to return to court for arraignment next month. According to the DFO statement, officials seized a 50-foot longline fishing boat in June 2020 as well as related fishing gear, two vehicles, a 28-foot enclosed trailer, a compact track loader, 7,461 pounds of halibut valued at approximately $40,000, including 17 undersized halibut, and $36,000 in cash. On Jan. 7, 2021, a total of 25 individual charges were laid for halibut fishing violations related to the case. Those charged in January 2021 are scheduled for a court appearance in spring 2022. No news release was issued related to this initial set of charges. Halibut is the most valuable species for groundfish licence holders in Nova Scotia. In 2019 landings were worth $49 million and accounted for well over half of the value of the groundfish fishery in the province. This is not the first DFO operation targeting the halibut fishery in Nova Scotia. In 2015, the last of 11 harvesters was convicted after a lengthy investigation into misreporting catches. In 2019, a Sambro halibut fisherman convicted of underreporting his catch by 40 per cent was ordered to pay an additional $49,376 penalty after a Supreme Court judge ruled a previous penalty for the repeat offender was too light. ""DFO is committed to protecting and safeguarding the long-term health and productivity of Canada's fisheries resources, and enforcing the regulations related to the harvesting, buying, selling and/or possession of fish,"" the department said in its statement Tuesday.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,‘You’re out there alone’: whistleblowers say workplace abuse hides true impacts of B.C.’s trawl fishery," The people Canada relies on to ensure the West Coast trawl fishery is operating within the law are frequently subjected to threats and harassment, making it perilous for them to do their jobs. The result is millions of pounds of wasted fish and untold environmental impacts, a months-long investigation by The Narwhal has found.  Workplace abuse has led observers to under-report the adverse impacts of trawl fishing and resulted in an estimated 140 million pounds of wasted fish. Put another way, that’s $1 billion in unaccounted catch in just over two decades. In 1996, Fisheries and Oceans Canada took the unprecedented step of closing the fishery for five months in the wake of years of over-harvesting.  B.C.’s bottom trawl fishery involves dragging a net through the water column or along the seabed, harvesting a variety of fish that live near the bottom of the ocean, including Pacific cod, hake, rockfish and pollock. The fishery was only permitted to reopen once it was guaranteed an independent observer would be stationed as a watchdog on each and every boat. Yet an imperfect system means observers — whose reports could ultimately result in a shut down of a boat or even the entire industry — are vulnerable to intimidation from ship skippers and crew members who at times exercise pressure on individuals to under-report their findings or look the other way. “It’s a very dangerous thing for observers to be out there,” said one observer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “You’re out there alone, often without cell service or contact.”  The Narwhal spoke with 11 current or former at-sea observers for this story. Many asked not to be named for fear of reprisal. Under the at-sea observer program, observers are required to estimate bycatch on ships, often while mountains of fish are being dumped on deck and unwanted species are being thrown overboard. Observers are also expected to take biological samples and count and assess the condition of prohibited species, which can include valuable fish like halibut, all while staying out of the way. In early April, Fisheries and Oceans Canada suddenly ordered the observers off the boats for 45 days due to safety concerns around COVID-19. But observers told The Narwhal they cannot safely and effectively perform their duties during normal times. The result is a fishery far less sustainable than the observer program is designed to guarantee.  “We’re totally destroying the [fisheries] for future generations. Completely,” Jon Eis, one of the whistleblowers, tells The Narwhal.  The testimony of observers, along with documents reviewed by The Narwhal, outline a system that is meant to protect and monitor a resource but instead rewards the actors most willing to break the rules.  During this investigation, Archipelago Marine Research, which provides all of the observers for the Pacific trawl fishery, instructed its employees not to speak with the media. Two Archipelago executives, Shawn Stebbins and Scott Buchanan, denied allegations that the company fails to protect its employees.  From the first net that was brought aboard the Raw Spirit in early December 2018, Eis knew he was on a collision course with the ship’s captain and co-owner, Kelly Andersen. On this trip, the Raw Spirit was fishing for turbot — a roughly triangular, low-value bottom-dwelling fish — on the so-called 800 line, a productive fishing ground off the southern tip of Haida Gwaii.  Yet it seemed for every 10 pounds of turbot pulled in by net, one pound of halibut was caught up as well. Halibut, a sought-after species that sells for more than 10 times the price of turbot, was not on the shopping list; trawlers aren’t allowed to keep it.  The inconvenient bycatch could have spelled financial disaster for Andersen, who was legally required to report the Raw Spirit’s poundage of dead halibut. The vessel was a mere 5,000 pounds from being shut down for the year, Eis says Andersen and others on the ship told him — an outcome that could have cost the skipper hundreds of thousands of dollars.  According to Eis, the halibut on board were in bad shape. Four crew members were tasked with separating the halibut from the rest of the catch and throwing them overboard, but struggled to do so before the fish suffocated. Others lay mangled in the back of the net, crushed by the weight of fish piled against them during a long tow. But, dead or alive, it is standard practice for trawlers to throw prohibited bycatch back. With thousands of pounds of turbot being caught, the halibut pounds, too, were adding up quickly.  Eis says Andersen reminded him of the ship’s annual halibut limit, which Eis perceived as a threat to not report beyond it. As the only observer aboard, it was Eis’s reporting that could get Andersen caught.  Fisheries observers are responsible for monitoring bycatch on industrial trawlers off the B.C. coast. Many of these individuals feel not enough is being done to protect them from intimidation and harassment while at sea. “It’s a very dangerous thing for observers to be out there,” one whistleblower told The Narwhal. “You’re out there alone, often without cell service or contact.” Illustration: Maria Nguyen / The Narwhal The Raw Spirit was brought to Canada from Norway in 2013. Its arrival on the coast was part of a new wave of trawling in B.C., as factory trawlers are capable of catching more fish, more quickly and — because they can process and freeze as much as a million or more pounds of fish onboard — can stay at sea longer than the previous generation of vessels. The Raw Spirit’s purchase was a joint venture between Andersen, the Jim Pattison-owned Canadian Fishing Company and Fisher Bay Seafood co-owners Tracy Ronlund and Theresa Williams. The net of a bottom trawler catches anything that can’t swim fast enough to escape, and its  potential damage to habitat — rare glass sponges and corals are often damaged in the drag —  means the trawl fishery has an outsized, if invisible, impact on the environment.  According to Scott Wallace, a research scientist with the David Suzuki Foundation, of all the ways humans interact with the natural environment on the B.C. coast, “the trawl fishery is the single biggest.” Despite the high percentage of halibut bycatch and even with a storm approaching, Eis says Andersen kept hammering at the same spot for days.  Eis says he felt pressured and eventually wrote down that Andersen’s crew had discarded 12,800 dead-weight pounds of halibut. (Dead weight is calculated based on the condition of the fish when they’re thrown overboard. A fish that appears full of life counts for less dead weight than a fish that is clearly already dead — though, even dead fish are given up to a 20 per cent chance of recovery.)  The reality, Eis says, was that the Raw Spirit killed closer to 50,000 pounds of halibut in just three and a half days.  “I’m trying to write down 25 per cent of what we really killed, and the skipper is freaking out,” Eis says. He says Andersen called the Archipelago Marine Research office to try to have that number reduced further. Archipelago would not confirm or deny that such a phone call was made, citing confidentiality concerns. Eis also says Andersen began a campaign of harassment toward him. He alleges Andersen became aggressive and threatening, yelling at him and “doing everything in his power” to make him change the number. Eis, who at that point had been an observer for 15 years, says he began locking the door to his cabin every night out of fear.  In an emailed statement to The Narwhal, Andersen says he regrets Eis’s “interpretation of his experience.”  The Narwhal followed up with two emails and a text message to ask for further comment, but Andersen did not respond to any other allegations raised in this story. Trawlers are not permitted to catch halibut, yet often accidentally do so when dragging their nets for other species. Although halibut must be returned to the ocean, many do not survive their capture and release. Fisheries observer Jon Eis said, while aboard the Raw Spirit, he witnessed the destruction of 50,000 pounds of halibut in just three days. Illustration: Carol Linnitt / The Narwhal Eis says he had experienced this kind of pressure before and estimates he regularly under-reported the waste of some species of fish, especially rockfish and halibut, by as much as 80 per cent.  As a fisheries observer, Eis was trained to combine his observations with statistics to make an educated guess about the bigger picture. So, asked for an estimate of how much waste he has seen go unreported in his 1,200 or so days at sea, Eis conservatively puts the figure at around three million pounds of fish — a number he says would have been several times higher had he not avoided factory trawlers whenever possible. (For comparison, B.C.’s total reported legal catch of black cod in 2017 was slightly over four million pounds; it was 8.4 million pounds for halibut.) Multiplied over dozens of active observers in the Pacific throughout the duration of the observer program, that estimate could add up to well over 140 million pounds of unreported waste on top of the reported bycatch. That would be an additional “shadow” waste of more than B.C.’s legal combined annual catch of rockfish, wild salmon, halibut, black cod, herring and all wild shellfish. It would be more than a billion dollars in fish that has gone completely unaccounted for in just over two decades.  According to a 2016 global study conducted by University of British Columbia researchers with Sea Around Us, a fisheries research initiative, the impact of fisheries has been under-reported by about 50 per cent, meaning millions more tonnes of fish are being taken out of the oceans than official reports suggest. The same researchers estimated worldwide bycatch to be 10.3 million tonnes per year — although there is no accounting for bycatch that goes unreported.  Eis and other observers say under-reporting is pervasive throughout the industry. Their personal accounts signal the potential for B.C.’s bycatch figures to be far higher than previously thought. Stebbins, Archipelago’s vice-president in charge of special projects, balked at the estimated volume of waste from the trawl industry, but agreed systemic under-reporting could be happening.  “I absolutely agree that could be a possibility,” he says. “It’s just common sense.”  Trawlers are problematic for their bycatch. Fisheries observers operating on the B.C. coast say they consistently underreport the amount of bycatch brought in by trawlers due to intimidation and harassment. Illustration: Maria Nguyen / The Narwhal Skippers and crews make their profit in a fine margin that exists between the cost of their quota (the fish they’re allowed to catch), the cost of their operating expenses, like food and fuel, and the money they can bring in by catching fish. Any additional expense, like catching prohibited fish and having to pay for extra quota, or having to move to a different fishing ground, cuts into profits.  “Morals and ethics don’t pay,” Eis says. “If you follow the regulations you make less money.”  Those who compromise their observers through bullying and threats avoid penalties, while observers who fail to do their jobs correctly are rewarded with bribes and a welcoming crew. Observers who try to report abuse say they’ve been ignored, belittled or fired. All the while, Archipelago gets paid as long as the fishermen are still leaving the harbour. For Eis, the volume of halibut waste that day on the Raw Spirit, combined with what he felt was abusive behaviour on Andersen’s part, was a bridge too far. “Something in my head just snapped,” he says.  He reported what happened to him on Raw Spirit to Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Archipelago Marine Research in early December 2018, days after it occurred. A government representative told him not to speak to the media, as did the trawl association and fishermen he trusted. “Morals and ethics don’t pay.” A spokesperson for Fisheries and Oceans Canada declined requests for an interview, saying an investigation is underway and the department could not comment on ongoing investigations. The spokesperson said the investigation “may cover multiple avenues of enquiry,” but would not address its focus.  In meeting notes obtained by The Narwhal, the department says it is “investigating several observer treatment [incidents].” In a meeting with The Narwhal, Archipelago managers refused to discuss the halibut incident, also citing the ongoing investigation, though Stebbins called it “a one-time occurrence.”  Eis says his efforts seemed futile. “Every step of the way, I felt that I was just squashed.” After waiting a year for the responsible parties to take action, he agreed to speak with The Narwhal. Eis says his experience with Andersen made him determined to make things right, even if it cost him his job. His last shift as an observer would be the trip on the Raw Spirit.  But according to interviews with other observers, the kind of pressure Eis faced is not uncommon. Many named Andersen as the worst perpetrator, but other skippers and ships were named in interviews as well.  Eis said he brought concerns about observer independence to Fisheries and Oceans Canada and after waiting one year, saw no response being taken. He has since come forward as a whistleblower. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal Eis flips through a species identification booklet at a beach in Victoria, B.C. Observers are responsible for taking biological samples and reporting the catch of prohibited species. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal Brian Mose, head of the Deep Sea Trawlers Association of British Columbia, is a fifth-generation fisherman. He grew up “crawling around the deck” on fishing boats, eventually buying two of his own as a teenager. Today, Mose owns multiple boats in the trawl fleet as well as a hook-and-line fishing boat.  “This is more serious than a heart attack for us,” he says of the mounting concern about abuse of the observer system. “If it’s possible for one, it’s possible for all,” Mose says. “We’ve identified three, four, five others.”  Despite the accusations against Andersen, which are well known throughout the trawl industry, he continues to sit on the trawl association’s board. “Legally, he has not been charged,” Mose says. “And there is nothing that we can prove to have him removed as a director.” The at-sea observer program is a system Mose actually fought against for years as a fisherman. He and Bruce Turris, a former Fisheries and Oceans Canada economist, are inseparable today but “weren’t the best of friends” in the early ’90s, he says.  At that time, industry was running roughshod over fish stocks and habitat. From 1980 until 1995, when the fishery was suspended, the trawl industry exceeded the maximum allowable catch every single year. In 1986 and 1987, the fishing fleet caught more than double the total amount of fish it was allowed to catch, overshooting by about 3,000 tonnes each year. Since data collection was spotty, the actual figures are likely much higher.  Turris, at that point in charge of the fishery, concluded the only solution was to shut it down. Trawlers were furious.  “We were in denial,” Mose says. “We thought the actions Bruce was taking were in excess of extreme.” Every year from 1980 to 1995 the trawl industry exceeded the amount of allowable catch. The fisheries observer program was implemented in 1995 as a solution to the problem of over fishing. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal The fishery reopened nearly five months later with one major change: there would be observers aboard the trawlers and others at shore to monitor the fish as it came in. The fishing companies would pay Fisheries and Oceans Canada, which would cover a third of the cost and contract the observers, ensuring their independence from industry. Observers were offered as a catch-all solution to a number of problems: they’d monitor species and bycatch, improve the behaviour of fishermen and improve the quality of data the government used to set quotas. Resellers would know their seafood is sustainable. And the public would know their resources are being protected. Over time the fishermen themselves would come around. While Mose once fought the system, he now defends it as indispensable to protecting the industry. He says fisheries managers come from all over the world to see how things are done in B.C. — and multiple statistical analyses have not found any evidence of systemic under-reporting of bycatch.  “We had gone from a complete absence in confidence in the data to now feeling that we had improved it enormously,” says Turris, who now heads up the Canadian Groundfish Research and Conservation Society. Andersen also sits on the society’s board, despite members questioning his suitability for the role.  But the system relies on the ability of observers to report what they see as accurately and honestly as possible. The observers say in many cases they can’t live up to that standard, and that the public’s trust is misplaced. “It makes you question the reliability of claims of sustainability of these fisheries,” says Misty MacDuffee, a conservation biologist at the Raincoast Conservation Foundation. Rules on what areas to open and close, what fish stocks to harvest or protect or what habitat to conserve in the name of sustainability can have dramatic effects on the fishermen and their livelihoods. Before the observers, the extra pressure from those decisions could be sloughed off; reporting was effectively optional, with devastating consequences for the environment.  But now that pressure falls squarely on the shoulders of the observers. Each time a trawler brings in a net full of prohibited fish, the observer is now required to make a difficult choice: report it — or don’t. In the early 2010s, Matt McKay was among the most experienced observers working for Archipelago Marine Research at sea.  “I’m a bit of a fish geek,” he says. “My species counts were always through the roof.”  If McKay didn’t know what species a fish was, he would put it aside for later then run through guides to figure it out. It slowly made him an authority on identification, and an excellent observer, according to others who crossed paths with him. He would regularly be invited on research trips, a sure sign of his expertise.  Archipelago sent McKay out on the factory trawler Viking Enterprise, the first ship of its class to be based on the B.C. coast, as a test. McKay was to help the company work out how to monitor ships like the Viking Enterprise that were to arrive in its wake — there would eventually be six. He was shocked at how the vessel operated. As the sole observer working among 20 or more crew, he was intimidated and outnumbered. Crews worked 24 hours a day, so he found it impossible to both do his job and sleep. Still, he tried his best to diligently report on the ship’s discards.  The skipper was Andersen, who McKay describes as “one of the skippers who will try to tell you what to write down.” McKay doubled down on his duties, working 18 hours a day to monitor as much as possible of what was happening on board. He measured more than 500 halibut by hand — an unheard-of level of granularity — to make sure he had as much evidence as he could. When he returned to Archipelago to debrief on what he had learned, he told them because of the nature of the ships, with upper and lower decks active at once, they needed two observers on board to make sure there could be enough coverage.  The Archipelago executives say they agreed with McKay, and passed the recommendation on to Fisheries and Oceans Canada. But for reasons unknown to Archipelago and McKay, the recommendation was never brought into effect. What did happen was a continuation of a culture of harassment that would force Eis and many others to under-report their numbers, McKay says, but now complicated further by the challenge of monitoring a giant ship without access to the whole vessel at once.  He says he faced regular bullying and threats from fishermen. “They’ll say, ‘People disappear at sea all the time,’ ” McKay says.  Worldwide, at least half a dozen observers have gone missing under mysterious circumstances, and there are likely more, says Liz Mitchell, president of the Association for Professional Observers. At a 2013 conference in Chile, she says, she learned of three more disappearances that had occurred there.  “Everywhere they go, observers get harassed,” she says. “[Abusers] get away with it because most people don’t even know what an observer is.” Former observer Matt McKay said observers are vulnerable at sea where he faced regular bullying. McKay said he has been told, ominously, that ‘people disappear at sea all the time.’ Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal Protecting the fishery was what inspired Kate Ramsay (her real name is being withheld upon her request) to become an observer — to “save the world,” she puts it. Like many observers, Ramsay only lasted six months on the job. That’s above average for an industry that chews through dozens of observers each year.  Archipelago says it has about a 40 to 60 per cent annual turnover, and insists that is normal for a fisheries observer company.  Even in her six months, though, Ramsay felt the pressure. She says it would come in the form of carrots and sticks — bribes for doing what the crews wanted, a lack of work for those who didn’t. Or worse. “If you change your numbers … [the fishermen] give you free fish, give you money,” she says. “If you say no, they’ll blacklist you.” She was aware that changing the documents could be considered fraud. As legal documents, the reports she filed would be relied on by the government to set quotas, and by scientists to do stock assessments. They are the basis for much of what the government and public think they know about many fisheries. “I do know of observers who have gotten too scared to not change their numbers,” she says. “They’re too scared of what the fishermen will do.” She was finally driven to quit, soon after a trip on the Raw Spirit. She says the factory manager would demand to see her notes, pressuring her to change her numbers; the crew would dissuade her from visiting the factory part of the ship because there was “nothing new to see;” they would hide things from her and accuse her of double-counting. The harassment escalated.  “It’s left an impression on me that I still haven’t shaken several years later,” she wrote in an email following her interview with The Narwhal. Ramsay felt the company did nothing to assure her they were taking her concerns seriously.  “Archipelago just laughed when I called them to talk about my experience,” she wrote. “They have a really hands-off approach. There’s almost no follow-up.” Stebbins of Archipelago says “if it’s accurate,” such a lack of response on Archipelago’s part would be “grounds for dismissal of the person they reported it to.” Some observers say raising concerns with Archipelago often resulted in no action; others reported losing work. The company says it’s possible they neglected to “close the loop” and inform the observer of what action had been taken. None of the observers The Narwhal spoke with could recall any concrete action the company had taken to rectify the problems they had reported, besides preventing one observer from working on the same ship in the future. Andersen, the skipper, was independently named by five different observers as having been abusive and unethical toward them while aboard the Raw Spirit and Viking Enterprise. Archipelago says it is aware of the allegations. Archipelago continues to provide the Raw Spirit and Viking Enterprise with observers. In his sole emailed statement, Andersen said, “I am deeply committed to actions that support the integrity of the At-Sea Observer Program and its continued development and improvement, as I have been since its inception in 1996.”  Several observers and fishermen pointed toward a specific moment when things took a turn for the worse: in 2012, when facing budget cuts by the Stephen Harper government, Fisheries and Oceans Canada backed away from its role as the intermediary for interactions between fishing companies and Archipelago. The department also stopped paying part of the cost of the observer program.  In 2013, fishing companies began dealing directly with Archipelago, and became responsible for paying 100 per cent of the cost. A 2016 report from the Auditor General of Canada examining Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s monitoring of nine of the fisheries under its jurisdiction (trawling was not among those looked at), identified some of the wider problems with the observer system.  The audit found that the 2012 cuts are where things went wrong, writing that the department had put itself in a position where its only recourse against offenders was to revoke their licences, which would rob the department of the data it needed to do its job. No Pacific region observer company has ever had its licence revoked by Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The audit went on to say the government had identified “a serious potential conflict of interest” for at least four companies that monitor fish catches, but that it had done nothing to mitigate the problem.  Of its three major divisions, fisheries monitoring makes up the largest percentage of Archipelago’s annual revenues. Archipelago says since at least the early 1990s, it has never permanently removed a ship or skipper from observer coverage, though Stebbins says when there have been major problems with a skipper, the companies that own the ships have solved the problem “quite quickly” by removing staff to protect their investments.  Archipelago denies the suggestion that its dependence on revenue from the ships it is supposed to be monitoring constitutes a conflict of interest. “The only reason we’re generating revenue is because we’re providing an arm’s-length service. That’s the basic tenet of our service,” Stebbins says. “Do we have complete control over every one of our employees? No. But we do the best we can.” A report by the Auditor General of Canada found problems were introduced to the observer program in 2013 when fishing companies became directly responsible for its funding. Photo: Taylor Roades / The Narwhal On a rainy day this past February, Turris, Mose, Wallace and Andersen gathered in a room at Simon Fraser University’s downtown campus in Vancouver, alongside other industry representatives and Fisheries and Oceans Canada officials, to discuss the upcoming year.  They were there to talk about the usual items (catch limits, marine protected areas, logbooks), but the one topic that got more time than any other hadn’t even been on the agenda until a week prior: the simmering crisis of observer abuse.  The Narwhal was not permitted by Fisheries and Oceans Canada to attend the meeting, but later obtained the meeting agenda and notes, and spoke with attendees.  Everyone at the meeting was aware that Eis, who had already contacted Archipelago, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and even the David Suzuki Foundation, had gone to the media and the story would become public. “The sense around the room was that it’s not a broken system,” says Wallace of the David Suzuki Foundation. “There seems to be nothing wrong with the system on paper.”  And yet the observer complaints show the system, even with its built-in checks and balances, wasn’t working.  “It makes me almost nauseous that this happens. This undermines everything,” he says. “You’ve got these old-lived species, you’ve got endangered species, you’ve got habitat … you need the observer program to work.” Fisheries and Oceans Canada presented a list of improvements that might plug some of the holes in the observer system, including new training to ensure observers know their rights and responsibilities. Conflict resolution training is also being added to the curriculum for new observers. Archipelago brought in new bullying policies with new ways to report problems up the ladder.  While these fixes rest on the shoulders of the observers, other measures appear poised to curb these pressures.  Cameras and other sensors have been installed on seven trawlers to measure when gear is moving, where fishing is happening and the fish sorting process as part of an electronic monitoring pilot program.  The captured data is randomly compared to observer reports, and fish discards have to match up (within a generous margin of error). If it doesn’t, the logbook is scrapped and the fishing company has to pay for an audit of the entire trip using only the electronic data, which could carry a hefty price tag. According to Archipelago, no fishing company has had to go through that process yet. Even so, the very presence of video footage has the potential to take the heat off individual observers. “As the fishery changes, the different pressures change out there for at-sea observer staff,” explains Scott Buchanan, director of fishery management programs for Archipelago. “There can be a lot of pressure on observers, so it’s important that the structure of how this works is designed so that that pressure can’t be applied, and they can do their job properly.”  As one fisherman put it: “You can’t bully a camera.” There’s another proposal in the works that could also alleviate some of the pressure on observers, one that would allow trawlers to keep 100 per cent of the rockfish they catch — even if it’s not on their list, even if they don’t own any quota for it.  As a deep-dwelling fish, when rockfish are brought to the surface they often die, their swim bladders popping out of their mouths as they expand. Throwing them back is frequently a futile exercise. Forcing fishermen to retain the fish would change two things: first, it would mean the pressure was no longer on the observer to look the other way, and second, it would mean the skipper would be better off moving his boat to a different area to avoid the cost of the extra fish.  After the government removed observers in April due to the coronavirus, the industry responded by asking that the adoption of electronic monitoring be accelerated, and that 100 per cent retention of rockfish be implemented immediately. Rather than taking the opportunity to weaken regulations, Mose and Turris and the fishermen they represent sent a letter to the government asking for tighter monitoring.  The proposal McKay made after his first test trip on the Viking Enterprise — that there be two observers on the large vessels, standard practice in Alaska — is still not on the table. Also standard practice in Alaska is providing observers with communication tools like encrypted text messages and personal locator beacons so they are not dependent on the ship’s own systems to communicate with the authorities in serious situations.  Archipelago said providing its observers with satellite phones is a possibility. “It could come to that, I guess,” Stebbins says.  Fisheries and Oceans Canada is considering improvements to the fisheries observer program to make the work more safe for individuals. It is not standard for fisheries observers in B.C. to be outfitted with personal locator beacons, which could provide a safe and secure form of communication. Illustration: Carol Linnitt / The Narwhal Brian Dickens can still remember steaming back toward Prince Rupert with 150,000 pounds of perch, at 15 years old, thinking about the 80-odd people the fish would employ at the end of its journey.  “I was so proud,” he recalls. “There was huge, huge honour in fishing.”  He still feels proud of what he does, and has been described by people throughout the industry as honest and reliable. When The Narwhal spoke with Dickens, he was unloading a similar load of fish — 120,000 pounds of rockfish — from his boat, the Nordic Pearl. Among all that fish, he says he caught and discarded just 16 halibut.  Dickens, now 63, grew up around the same time as Andersen, fishing the same waters. At that time, nobody believed they could harm fish stocks; it was an infinite resource, invincible to the nets and hooks by force of sheer numbers.  “Some of us have grown out of that, and some of us haven’t,” he says.  The reality is that every fish killed incidentally is a lost chance to reproduce, or to feed the predators and scavengers of its own habitat rather than feeding the birds and sea lions at the surface. For those fishermen who believe bycatch is not a significant problem, he says, the challenge is not to avoid waste — it’s to avoid getting caught.  “There’s a culture that has developed. It hasn’t developed because these people are evil, it’s human nature,” Dickens says. “If you can get away with it, that’s what you’re going to do.”  Human nature, in all its predictable excesses, also explains why Kelly Andersen is, at the time of writing, in Denmark: he’s buying a bigger ship. The vessel is a factory trawler with twice the power of the Raw Spirit and 15 per cent more capacity. Most significantly, it will be the first in the province to house a reduction plant, capable of rendering fish down into anonymous fish meal long before the ship ever reaches shore. “I just don’t believe that he’s the right kind of person to have that kind of power,” Dickens says. “Kelly Andersen is seemingly operating with impunity.” As with Raw Spirit, Andersen has partnered with the Canadian Fishing Company to buy the new ship.  Phil Young, senior director of sales at the company, says he hasn’t heard anything that makes him question the wisdom of doubling down on the company’s investment with Andersen. Nothing official, anyway.  “Have we heard rumours? Yeah,” he says. “Rumours are rumours.”  The ship’s other co-owners are equally reluctant to take action based on what they see as a difference of interpretation. In an email, Theresa Williams wrote, “I believe it is impossible to know all the nuances of the conversations that may be at the core of the observer’s complaint from December 2018, and it’s fair to say that there is a difference between telling someone what to report and disagreeing with what they report.”  She said she is aware of a possible investigation from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and that her company has taken steps to ensure its crew members understand the importance of preserving observers’ ability to do their jobs. “If you can get away with it, that’s what you’re going to do.”  For the observers, the ability to make judgments independently of the crews they’re monitoring is a matter of safety and integrity. Those who are still in the business could see an improvement, but for the whistleblowers like Eis and McKay, the change is coming too late. Eis says Archipelago never formally fired him; work just stopped arriving when he began fighting to fix the system. But the company has referred to him in communications with its staff only as a former employee.  Matt McKay, the self-described “fish nerd,” is now a mushroom picker. Ramsay moved on to a related industry, as did others who spoke with The Narwhal. Some are still working for Archipelago. Eis has found work, a few months out of the year, doing scientific fish surveys for the International Pacific Halibut Commission, an intergovernmental agency that monitors halibut stocks. There, at last, he feels rewarded when he does his job, rather than when he doesn’t. It’s a job he believes is vital to protecting the future of fisheries, to making sure that when future generations put a line in the water they can catch something to bring home to their families.  “Once there’s nothing left in the ocean,” he says, “it doesn’t matter how good a fisherman you are.” Update May 11, 2020 at 1:02 p.m. PST: A previous version of this story noted estimated worldwide bycatch was 10.3 million pounds per year. The correct amount is actually 10.3 million tonnes per year and the story has been updated to reflect that fact. Update May 13, 2020 at 10:39 a.m. PST: This article was updated to reflect the fact that while observer reports can result in the shutdown of boats or even the entire industry, this power does not rest with observers but rather with Fisheries and Oceans Canada which has the authority to act on the information in those reports.

June 3, 2021April 12, 2024
 The United Nations uses 5 June every year as an opportunity to draw public attention to the negative impacts of IUU, which undermine its sustainable development goals to ensure fisheries can provide food and jobs. This year, questions over sustainability and the consumption of seafood have found their way into mainstream debate following a controversial Netflix documentary, Seaspiracy. More than a third (34%) of the world’s fish stocks are overfished, meaning taken at a rate where they cannot replenish themselves. Illegal activity adds even more pressure, degrading the marine environment, making it harder to determine fish numbers, and harming the prospects of legal fishers and people in the poorest parts of the world. Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) includes all fishing that breaks fisheries laws and regulations or occurs outside their reach. Illegal fishing usually means without a licence, in an area where fishing is banned, with prohibited gear, over a quota, or for protected species. Very often it’s a vessel entering a nation’s water with no fishing licence, or fishing with a licence but catching more than is allowed.   Then there is the problem of unreported and under-reported catches by licensed vessels looking to flout quotas or catch prohibited species. Though most of the world’s fish are caught in the national waters of coastal states – within 200 nautical miles of their shorelines – a lot of unregulated fishing occurs beyond that on the high seas which cover almost 45% of our planet. ­Patchy regulation and enforcement in this vast area allow rampant IUU. IUU occurs everywhere, from shallow coastal or inland waters to the most remote stretches of the ocean. It particularly affects nations in the global south where fisheries management may be poorly developed, or where there are limited resources to oversee their waters or enforce regulations. West Africa and the Western Central Pacific are assessed as having the highest rates of illegal fishing, followed by the Bering Sea and the Southwest Atlantic. There are no reliable figures on global IUU – but experts estimate that more than one in five (22%) landed fish is caught illegally, with this figure rising as to one in four off Africa. Every year, an estimated $26-50 billion worth of revenue is lost to IUU. IUU contributes to the over-exploitation of fish populations, hinders their recovery and damages the marine environment. Thousands of marine species die as bycatch and delicate habitats are destroyed by the unregulated use of harmful practices like bottom-trawling. $26-50 billion of fish is lost to IUU every year IUU adversely affects the wellbeing of fishing communities, especially in the global south where many people rely on fish for food and revenue. It exacerbates poverty and contributes heavily to food insecurity. It also has direct ties to organised crime including human trafficking, drug smuggling, and slavery. The main driver is money – fishers pay no taxes or duties on their illegal catches. But IUU only happens because offenders can get away with it. It is most common in countries unable to set up or enforce effective fisheries controls. One major obstacle in the fight against IUU is flags of convenience – flown by foreign fishing vessels to take advantage of minimal regulation, cheap registration fees, low or no taxes and the ability to employ cheap labour. While the practice is not illegal, using a flag of convenience allows IUU fishers to conceal their operations or avoid international laws designed to conserve marine resources. Thirty-five nations have open registries where an owner doesn’t need to meet any nationality or residency requirements. The most famous is Panama – a tiny nation with the world’s largest shipping fleet (by some estimates). But land-locked countries such as Bolivia and Mongolia are also involved. Open registries conceal the true owners of a vessel; facilitate tax avoidance and appalling working conditions for seafarers; and are linked to devastating oil spills. Chinese vessels conduct an illegal transshipment off the coast of West Africa © Anonymous  Another common IUU practice is transshipment – where vessels fishing in the high seas for high-value species like tuna offload their catch onto refrigerated transport vessels known as “reefers”. The reefers bring food, fuel, bait and labour and take away the catch as boxes of frozen fish. It is technically legal, and a cost-effective way for vessels to remain at sea for longer. But because the  vessels do not come into port, it is hard to determine whether the catch is legal.  A number of mechanisms exist or are being negotiated over in an attempt to bring an end to this damaging black market. The UN has chosen 5 June as Fight against IUU Day because it’s the anniversary of when the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) came into effect in June 2016. This is the first binding international agreement to stop illegally caught fish entering markets through ports. To date, 68 nations plus the European Union are party to the PSMA. China, as the world’s fishing superpower, is key, and it is hoped it will ratify it soon.

  The UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 14, “Life Below Water”, calls for an end to harmful subsidies that contribute to overcapacity, overfishing and IUU. The World Trade Organisation has been trying to resolve this issue for nearly 20 years, and last year it failed to meet its 2020 deadline, partly due to Covid-19. But there are signs a deal may finally be in sight: the new director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria, has made fisheries subsidies a priority, and is convening a ministerial conference in July with the aim of finalising negotiations. Better monitoring, control and surveillance are defending marine protected areas globally and there are industry and national efforts to increase the traceability of seafood throughout the supply chain. Technology such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS), automatic identification systems (AIS) and on-board Electronic Monitoring is helping authorities spot vessels fishing beyond legal limits. Ultimately, IUU fishing is a response to the ever-increasing global appetite for seafood. Consumers can play their part alongside international efforts by making informed choices where possible. Look for trusted labels such as the international Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) which verifies your fish was caught transparently. Or use online resources to learn about which species are best to buy and which to avoid. Put pressure on your country’s representatives to reach an ambitious deal at the WTO subsidies negotiations.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,Exclusive: Shark finning rampant across Chinese tuna firm's fleet,,2022-11-01
Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,"Thousands of endangered sharks slaughtered by overfishing, new report reveals"," (Amsterdam) Activists from Greenpeace International confronted a fishing vessel yesterday around 200 miles away from The Azores as it was hauling in sharks on a longline, capturing shocking footage of their practices [see here]. The peaceful protest saw activists unfurl a banner with the message “Sharks Under Attack” and came as Greenpeace International releases a new report that reveals lack of protection in international waters is resulting in the deaths of tens of thousands of endangered sharks each year.  In the North Atlantic, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza documented fishing vessels which, while known to be primarily catching swordfish, in fact collectively catch four times more sharks than swordfish (by weight).[1] During the protest, the crew saw only one swordfish being caught by the Spanish vessel Ameal and at least 8 sharks pulled from a line nearly 40 miles long. The shark species are currently being identified.  “It is absolutely immoral to kill sharks and other wildlife with these terrible fishing practices. We are exposing the culprits at sea now, but we urgently need a strong treaty and tighter fishing limits to protect our global oceans,” said Will McCallum, of Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign, on board the Esperanza. The report also highlights the devastating impact that overfishing is having on shortfin mako shark populations, the world’s fastest shark, which is closely related to the great white. Greenpeace’s analysis shows that Spanish and Portuguese ships in the area are catching as many as 25,000 mako sharks annually.[2]  The vessels follow migratory routes of swordfish, using destructive methods like kilometre long lines with thousands of hooks, which also kill sharks and other animals. Sharks are mainly targeted for their fins, which some cultures prize as a delicacy. An estimated 100 million sharks are killed every year.[3] Greenpeace analysis shows that, despite official estimates that immediately stopping all catch of shortfin mako would result in only a 50% chance of their population recovering by 2040, the most recent catch data was 3,112 tonnes in 2017, equating to as many as 25,000 endangered sharks.[4] The report is launched as the Esperanza sails from the Arctic to the Antarctic undertaking ground-breaking research and investigations to campaign for a strong Global Ocean Treaty at the United Nations. A strong treaty could pave the way for the creation of ocean sanctuaries in 30% of the high seas by 2030, placing vast areas of the sea off-limits to harmful human activities and allowing marine life to recover.  Today there is no legal mechanism to create ocean sanctuaries in international waters and only around 1% of the oceans are fully protected. Alongside the widespread failure of industry and regional bodies to stick to scientific advice, this enables the fishing industry to devastate marine ecosystems by using harmful practices to overfish, often in sensitive areas, and decimate shark populations worldwide. Many species of sharks are in danger of extinction and some populations have decreased by as much as 99% due to human activity.[5][6] Lifelong UK fisherman Jerry Percy, who has represented small–scale, sustainable fishermen across Europe, was on board the Esperanza and said:  “Smaller scale fishermen rely on healthy populations of sharks and other fish species at the top of the food chain to maintain the balance of marine life in the oceans. This allows us to make a sustainable living and at the same time support vulnerable coastal communities. But unregulated and lawless fishing is putting all this at risk, for short term profit for the few but long term losses for the many.” Greenpeace’s McCallum added, “people all over the world need healthy oceans to survive as much as the creatures that live in them. It’s time for us to cover the high seas with marine protected areas and give our blue planet a chance to recover.”  -30- Photo and video from North Atlantic fishing and other harmful fishing practices available here.

 26k Accesses 115 Citations 399 Altmetric Metrics details Fishing takes place in the high seas and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of maritime countries. Closing the former to fishing has recently been proposed in the literature and is currently an issue of debate in various international fora. We determine the degree of overlap between fish caught in these two areas of the ocean, examine how global catch might change if catches of straddling species or taxon groups increase within EEZs as a result of protection of adjacent high seas; and identify countries that are likely to gain or lose in total catch quantity and value following high-seas closure. We find that <0.01% of the quantity and value of commercial fish taxa are obtained from catch taken exclusively in the high seas and if the catch of straddling taxa increases by 18% on average following closure because of spillover, there would be no loss in global catch. The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, would decrease from 0.66 to 0.33. Thus, closing the high seas could be catch-neutral while inequality in the distribution of fisheries benefits among the world's maritime countries could be reduced by 50%. Fishing, arguably one of the most valuable aquatic ecosystem provisioning services to people, takes place in coastal areas, i.e., within Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and in the high seas. EEZs are areas of the global ocean within 200 nautical miles of the coast of maritime countries which claim sole rights to the resources found within them. In contrast, the high seas are international waters and are therefore ‘owned’ by all citizens of the world. Over the past decades, fishing has expanded into the high seas because of overexploitation of coastal waters, increasing demand for fish driven by increasing world population and rising incomes, provision of government subsidies and technological innovation1,2. The increasing exploitation of fish on the high seas has caused concern among scientists, economists, lawyers, governments, non-governmental organizations and the public for several reasons. Inadequate management has led to overfishing of many economically important fish stocks3 and the fisheries exploiting these resources have been associated with by-catch of threatened or vulnerable species and habitat destruction4. The current status of a number of highly migratory, pelagic species such as tunas and billfishes is particularly worrying5. Overall, stocks of tunas and their relatives have declined on average by 60% during the last half century and the majority of these stocks are either fully or overexploited5. Deep-sea fishes are also a serious concern. The depth of the high seas, with little light and food available, provides habitat for fishes that are often long lived and slow growing, characteristics that make them vulnerable to overfishing6. Additionally, despite the technological advances that have allowed us to fish at great depths and the new knowledge we are currently accumulating, the vast majority of the deep ocean remains unexplored and poorly understood7. The ecological impacts of deep-sea fishing activities are also largely unknown8. Economic concerns centre on the fact that many fisheries exploiting high-seas resources would not be viable without government subsidies and socially, only provide jobs and significant incomes to relatively few9. From a legal standpoint, both fish and fishers of the high seas are the least protected by international agreements10, leaving those working on high-seas vessels vulnerable to exploitative treatment and unsafe working conditions. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was signed in 1982, when it was thought that the impact of fishing would not be significant in the high seas because of technological limitations and this area's generally low biological productivity11. Now, everything we know about deep-sea habitats and fishing methods such as bottom trawling suggest that the two are incompatible and mounting evidence supports the view that deep-sea ecosystems are in need of urgent protection8. Large marine protected areas (MPAs) in the high seas are of increasing interest9,12,13 and their benefits could be far-reaching. Currently, Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) are implementing fisheries closures to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems in some parts of the high seas. However, there is no effective, coherent management framework for this important part of the global ocean14 and RFMOs are generally failing to meet the larger mandates under the United Nations and even their own Conventions10,15. As of 2010, two thirds of all stocks of known status under RFMO management were depleted or being overfished3. Importantly, the depletion of high-seas stocks can influence the availability of fish to coastal fleets. We now know that many ocean predators forage in both EEZs and the high seas in the course of a year, exploiting different regions of high prey availability16. Some ‘high-seas’ species therefore straddle EEZ boundaries; hence, mismanaging the high seas also can have direct repercussions on coastal communities and ecosystems. The degree of overlap between the fish currently caught in the high seas and the EEZs has to date not been assessed, but it potentially has important ramifications for fisheries. White & Costello17 suggested positive economic benefits from closing the high seas because although the management of fisheries that operate in EEZs is far from perfect, these fisheries are generally relatively better managed than high-seas fisheries18. Our goal here is to examine this idea with empirical fisheries data to assess the impacts of a high-seas closure on global fisheries catches and values and the economic consequences for individual countries. First, we analyze global fish catch and landed values to determine how much fish is caught in the high seas versus in EEZs. Specifically, we estimate the global average annual catch and landed values for each species/taxon group caught (i) exclusively in the high seas; (ii) exclusively in EEZs; and (iii) in both the high seas and the EEZs (i.e., straddling taxa). Second, we examine how the availability of fisheries resources to coastal countries could change following a high-seas closure and identify the countries that stand to gain or lose, considering potential spillover of biomass from closed areas and lost fishing opportunities in the high seas. We ask what percentage increase in the catch of straddling taxa would make closing the high seas catch-neutral. The result obtained is compared with a range of potential increases in these catches predicted by White & Costello17.To explore the sensitivity of our results to uncertainty and our assumptions, we simulate various scenarios of increasing total catch of straddling taxa with the closure of the high seas. We then identify winners and losers in terms of catch and landed value by country or political entity under the different scenarios studied. Finally, we assess the distribution of these benefits under the status quo and with a closure by calculating the Gini coefficient, which we use to measure the extent of landed value disparity among countries or political entities. Of the 1,406 taxa analyzed, 585 were caught both within EEZs and high seas, while 802 were caught only within EEZs and only 19 exclusively in the high seas (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1). In other words, ~42% of the taxa can be considered ‘straddling’, while only ~1.5% are exclusively high seas. The importance of straddling taxa increases greatly when viewed in terms of global catch amount (67%) and landed value (72%) (Fig. 1). Average annual portions of taxa taken from the high seas only, from both the high seas and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and from EEZs only based on global catch statistics 2000–2010. (a), Number of taxa (total = 1,406); (b), Catch quantities (thousand t) (total = 80,028); and c, Landed values (million US$) (total = 108,585). Between 2000 and 2010, an average of 10 million t of fish was caught annually in the high seas (Table 1). This represents ~12% of the global average annual marine fisheries catch of 80 million t. The landed value of this catch is estimated at about US$16 billion annually (Table 1), which makes up about 15% of the total global marine landed value of about US$109 billion19. In contrast, the high seas represent approximately 58% of the global ocean surface. The top 10 taxa caught in the high seas generate average annual catch and landed values of 7 million t and US$12 billion, respectively (Table 1). Excluding small pelagic fishes, which are mainly coastal, the 10 leading high-seas fishing nations together land 62% of the high-seas catch and capture 71% of the landed values, respectively (Table 2). These numbers immediately raise equity and social concerns – a few countries take a large proportion of the benefits from an internationally shared area. Importantly, of the annual average 10 million t of high-seas catch, only 3,000 t (annual landed value of US$3 million) consist of taxa exclusively caught in the high seas (Table 1, Fig. 1). In contrast, species that are caught only within EEZs total 26.4 million t, generating US$30.4 billion annually (Fig. 1). The bulk of global fish catch and landed value are of taxa caught in both the high seas and the EEZs of maritime countries, amounting to an average of 53.6 million t and US$78.2 billion per year, respectively (Fig. 1). Many of these straddling taxa are oceanodromous taxa with widespread distributions (Supplementary Table 1). These results illustrate strong ecological and economic sharing between EEZs and the high seas. We find that closure of the high seas would not lead to losses in aggregate global catch if catches of straddling taxa within EEZs following the closure increase by at least 18%, on average, due to the spillover of biomass from the closed high seas areas. This percentage is below the modelled example estimate of 42% catch increase explored in White & Costello17 and at the low end of the predicted minimum and maximum range of 10 to 70% that was associated with this modelled scenario. With an 18% increase in the catches of straddling taxa, 120 maritime countries experience net gains in the landed values of their fisheries catches, 65 countries experience net losses and seven countries experience neither gains nor losses (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2). In addition, the global distribution of landed values derived from a high seas closure improves markedly, as the Gini coefficient declines from 0.66 (close to the coefficient estimated for incomes in South Africa, the country with the most unequal income distribution in the world at 0.7) currently to 0.33 (similar to Japan's score)20 (Fig. 3). The countries or political entities that would benefit the most from a closure are the USA, Guam and the UK, all with gains in total landed values of over US$250 million a year, while the countries that would lose the most are South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, each with losses of over US$800 million per year (Supplementary Table 2). Global map of the predicted distribution of gains or losses in total marine fisheries landed values. Based on a scenario where the catch of straddling taxa increase by 18% following a high-seas closure. Current landed value is the product of catch and ex-vessel price. Catch data were extracted from the Sea Around Us global catch database26 (www.seaaroundus.org) while ex-vessel prices were obtained from Sumaila et al.29 and Swartz et al.19. The annual catch of straddling taxa by each fishing country was projected to increase by 18% under the high-seas closure scenario, whereas the catch of non-straddling taxa remains unchanged. Countries with negative and positive change in landed values were labelled “Loss” and “Gain” in the map, respectively. ESRI ArcMap 10.1. was used to create the map. Lorenz curves showing the cumulative percentages of relative landed values obtained from the high seas under the status quo and a closure (to fishing) scenario against the cumulative percentages of countries, starting with the country that obtains the lowest relative landed value. The closure scenario shown assumes that the catch of straddling taxa following the closure increases by at least 18%. Under this scenario, the Gini coefficient drops by 50%, from 0.66 to 0.33. Using the predicted 42% yield increase by White and Costello17, the global catch and landed values increase by 11 million t and US$13 billion (16% and 15% higher, respectively) per year relative to the status quo. In this scenario, 135 countries experience net gains in landed values, 50 countries experience net losses and seven countries experience neither gains nor losses (Supplementary Table 2). Given this scenario, the countries or political entities that would benefit the most from a closure are the USA, China and Japan, all with gains in total landed values of over US$1.2 billion a year. On the other hand, those that are predicted to lose the most are Taiwan and South Korea, each with losses of over US$500 million (Supplementary Table 2). Considering groups of countries or political entities with economic or geographic similarities, our analyses suggest that European Union (EU) Member States, the Group of Eight (G8) countries, members of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and the Least Developed Countries, as identified by the United Nations (UN), all fare better in terms of forecasted average percentage gains than all countries considered together under every scenario examined (Supplementary Table 3). The top 10 countries that currently catch the most by value in the high seas, the Small Island Developing States (SIDS), as identified by the UN and the group of ‘Flag of Convenience (FoC) countries’, i.e., those for which 50% or more of the fishing vessels in the fleet are flying the flag of a state that does not match the state of vessel owner control or residence (Supplementary Table 4), all fare worse than all countries considered together under every scenario examined. Note that a number of SIDS provide Flags of Convenience and thus losses designated here to SIDS may actually be losses to beneficial vessel owners from other nations. A follow up analysis is currently being undertaken to investigate this result further. Notably, the outcome for the group of FoC countries was consistently the worst, resulting in an average percentage loss under every scenario except when the catches of straddling taxa is assumed to increase by 70% (Supplementary Table 3). Our analyses suggest that with a >18% increase in catch of straddling taxa following a closure of the high seas to fishing, the world as a whole would achieve net gains in catch relative to the status quo. At the country or political entity level, some countries would gain while others would lose, but most coastal countries stand to gain, including in particular, the world's least developed countries. It therefore seems that closing the high seas to fishing would provide net benefits globally, while improving the distribution of such benefits among coastal countries relative to the current situation, where only 10 fishing countries capture most of the high-seas catch and landed values (Table 2). We acknowledge that our global analysis has incorporated a number of broadly applied assumptions. Most importantly, we have assumed that the catch data used are generally representative of true fisheries catches and that over or under-reporting of catches of straddling taxa is not significant. In addition, we have applied scenarios of increased catches of straddling taxa within EEZs following high-seas closure evenly across all EEZs. Realistically, geographic and interspecific variation exists in both the accuracy of reported data and the potential spillover of biomass from closed high seas areas, though addressing expected ranges of uncertainty is outside the scope of this study. Instead, we provide a foundation for more detailed analyses of the costs and benefits of global high-seas closure. Whether or not the specific fishing outcomes predicted here would materialize, there would be other significant consequences to closing the high-seas. In general, vessels fishing the high seas travel longer distances, spend longer searching for fish and therefore incur a higher cost per unit weight of fish than vessels fishing solely within EEZs. This means that closing the high seas would, all else being equal, reduce the burning of fossil fuel and the cost of fishing globally. As of 2000, fishing vessels burned approximately 50 billion L of fuel annually, which accounted for ~1.2% of global oil consumption and resulted in the direct emission of more than 130 million t of CO2 into the atmosphere21. Though these estimates are substantial, they are likely highly conservative as illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities, many of which occur on the high seas, were not taken into account in these calculations21,22. It should also be noted that climate-induced changes in distributions of fish species23 would likely affect the economies of tropical developing countries, hence reinforcing our argument for a more equitable distribution of benefits derived from fisheries resources24. An issue that naturally arises from proposals to close the high seas to fishing is how to implement, monitor and control such a large area of the ocean to prevent illegal fishing. Implementing a closure of the high seas would require fundamental reform of ocean governance through a new implementing agreement added to the UNCLOS and by supporting measures within other UN bodies such as the FAO and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Whilst this may be viewed as unrealistic, the expansion of human activities in the high seas may mean that spatial planning will become a necessity in the near future in any case, driving reform of the governance of this area. Ensuring the effective enforcement of a high-seas closure would require cooperation amongst a network of geographically dispersed and technologically equipped coastal States, or the creation of a new global policing agency, established and funded under the UN or alternatively, the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). Penalties imposed on violators could help offset additional administrative and operational costs. Amendments to existing legislation could also be introduced to make enforcement possible and straightforward. For example, the International Maritime Organization's International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) could be amended so that the mandatory requirement for shipping vessels to carry and actively use an Automatic Identification System (AIS) and to have a mandatory and permanent vessel identification number could also be applied to fishing vessels25. These potential options and other questions regarding the logistics of closing the high seas to fishing remain to be explored fully, but the satellite technology for surveillance exists and is currently used by the shipping industry. It just needs to be used to the same extent by the fishing industry as well. Based on our analysis, we argue that it would be more equitable and environmentally and economically sensible to close the high seas to fishing, i.e., to turn the high seas into a fish bank for the world. The usual reaction to this argument is that it will lead to massive risks to food security (through reduction in catches), employment, revenues and profits – but our results suggest that this is unlikely to be the case and that it is likely that the reverse is true. We used catch data from 2000 to 2010 from the Sea Around Us, which is quality-checked and mapped to a grid of 30′ by 30′ spatial cells26. The mapped fisheries landings dataset used was reported global landings from 1950 to 2010 inclusive and originated from the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) fisheries database, supplemented by its regional datasets, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), regional tuna organizations, the North Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) and the secretariat of the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)26. These statistics, after harmonization, were disaggregated into a spatial grid system that breaks down the world's ocean into 180 000 cells (0.5° latitude by 0.5° longitude), using a rule-based approach based on the geographical distribution of over 1500 commercially exploited fish and invertebrate taxa. Ancillary data were also integrated, such as the fishing agreements regulating foreign access to the EEZs of maritime countries and a database of their observed fishing patterns. The FAO created a database of these agreements called Farisis27. We further developed and widely expanded the contents of this database so that it could be used in the spatial allocation process to guide, where possible, the allocation of catches to coastal waters, which have one or more EEZ claims on them. This additional information includes all reports we could locate documenting fishing by one nation in another nation's coastal waters. Fisheries landings were allocated to spatial cells within the reported statistical area, which were either high seas (not claimed by any country) or in EEZ-claimed waters where the fishing country was known to be fishing and/or have access arrangements pertinent to the reported catch. The proportion of landings assigned to these valid cells was apportioned according to the applicable distribution of the reported species (or group) and the ocean area within the cell. As these data were derived largely from raw data reported by the FAO, they are not strictly ‘catches’ but largely represent ‘landings’ only, i.e., the portion that was retained and reported. For each country, the 30′ × 30′ spatial cells that comprise their EEZ claim (disputed or otherwise)28 were used to determine the mapped landings reported from their EEZ. Since the last allocation of data (through 2006), there has not been another update on the spatial landings data to include more recent global landings from the FAO. However, the Sea Around Us extended the catch series for the present study based on FAO reported landings from 2007–2010. This was first performed by comparing the complete list of taxa in the Sea Around Us catch database with a list of all taxa occurring in the FAO data from 2007–2010. We then calculated the proportions of each taxon in the Sea Around Us catch database by each fishing country within each EEZ and high seas in an FAO statistical area for 2006. Finally, we used these proportions to allocate the taxon-specific landings in the 2007–2010 FAO data to each EEZ by each fishing country within an FAO statistical area in which that taxon was caught. The results are catch time series for most species that run from 2007 to 2010. The extended catch data from 2007 to 2010 in the Sea Around Us database were allocated to each EEZ and the high seas. These were linked to ex-vessel fish price data19,29 for all taxa caught in the global ocean. We then estimated the global average annual catch and landed values for each species/taxon group caught (i) exclusively in the high seas; (ii) exclusively in EEZs; and (iii) in both the high seas and the EEZs (i.e., straddling taxa). We calculated the expected total gains or losses in catch quantity and landed value by country or political entity following a high-seas closure for the scenarios where the percentage increase in EEZ catches of straddling taxa would result in no loss of aggregate global catch and landed value (18% and 20%, respectively). This was accomplished by first subtracting all catches taken from the high seas from the total catches for each year from 2000 to 2010, then multiplying the catches of straddling taxa caught within each EEZ by 18% and then by 20% (for both scenarios) for each fishing country. In addition, we calculated the same for scenarios where catches of straddling taxa would increase by 10%, 42% and 70%, as predicted by White & Costello17. We further analysed gains and losses by different groups of countries: members of the Group of Eight (G8); members of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD); the top ten countries that currently catch the most by value in the high seas; member states of the European Union (EU); the Least Developed Countries, as identified by the United Nations (UN); the Small Island Developing States (SIDS), as identified by the UN; and ‘Flag of Convenience (FoC) countries’, i.e., those for which over 50% of the fishing vessels that fish under their flag are flying the flag of a state that does not match the state of vessel owner control or residence (Supplementary Table 4). These were identified based on global fishing fleet information provided by Sea-Web in January of 2013 (www.sea-web.com). We calculated the Gini coefficient for the status quo and the catch-neutral scenario after closure to assess the degree to which the distribution of landed values amongst maritime countries is equitable. For our purposes, the Gini coefficient measures the extent to which the distribution of landed value among maritime countries deviates from a perfectly equal distribution. Lorenz curves fitted the cumulative percentages of relative landed values obtained from the high seas under the status quo and closure (to fishing) scenario against the cumulative number of countries, starting with the country that obtains the lowest relative landed value. The Gini coefficient measures the area between the Lorenz curve and a hypothetical line of absolute equality, expressed as a ratio of the maximum area under the line. Therefore a Gini coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 1 implies perfect inequality. Swartz, W., Sala, E., Tracey, S., Watson, R. & Pauly, D.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Google,Fish and ships: Chinese fishing and Europe's Indo-Pacific strategy," The Africa programme analyses the geopolitics of the Africa-Europe relationship. In particular, the programme delves into relations between the African Union and the European Union to find creative foreign policy tools and strategies. It also focuses on two regions that are particularly relevant for Europe: the Horn of Africa and the Sahel. The Asia programme seeks to help Europe recalibrate its relationship with China and its Asian partners. The programme analyses China’s domestic situation, its role in the region, and its increasing global influence. It also places a renewed emphasis on fostering Europe’s relationships with the Indo-Pacific, especially India and Japan. The European Power programme is focused on helping Europeans develop sustainable policy solutions to the issues affecting the European Union’s capacity to act with unity on the global scene. This includes analysing the path forward for enlargement, the energy transition, and European support for Ukraine. The Middle East and North Africa programme seeks to support a coherent European agenda in pursuit of regional interests. The programme works with European and regional governments, local voices, and civil society to advance channels of dialogue as well as providing direct policy prescriptions to secure conflict de-escalation, regional stabilisation, and democratic transition. The US programme helps Europeans create policy responses to developments in US domestic politics and foreign policy. The programme seeks to strengthen transatlantic relations by exploring the obstacles to a more balanced partnership and developing ideas to overcome them. The Wider Europe programme aims to help the European Union defend its interests and values in the Western Balkans, Turkey, Russia, and eastern Europe, as well as the South Caucasus and central Asia. The programme also supports EU decision-makers work on a unified and coherent policy to address the challenges resulting from Russia’s full scale-invasion of Ukraine. The fisheries sector has gradually become a central geopolitical issue in the Indo-Pacific. Out of the 84.4m tonnes of fish caught in seas across the world in 2018, around 61.4m tonnes came from the Indian and Pacific oceans. Although the intensity of fishing varies across regions, the depletion of fishery resources is a growing problem everywhere. China, which catches more fish than any other nation, vastly contributes to this problem with not only its fleet size and the tonnage of its catches, but also its fishing practices – which include illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing – and, above all, a fisheries policy that exports its environmental problems and thereby protects its own national marine areas. Moreover, China instrumentalises fishing to serve its revisionist agenda and its strategic interests more broadly, signalling its willingness to use traditional economic activities for geopolitical gain. The specific problem of China’s fisheries policy exacerbates the broader one of a global decline in fish stocks, which are being exploited at unsustainable levels for one-third of all affected species. In recent decades, fish consumption has risen at an annual rate twice that of population growth, from 9kg per person in 1961 to more than 20kg per person in 2016. While the global tonnage of fish caught has been relatively stable since the 1990s, the past 50 years have seen a clear downward trend in the share of fish stocks that are at sustainable levels, from 90 per cent in 1974 to 65.8 per cent in 2017. However, the sustainability level varies across different zones of the Indo-Pacific. It is at 54.5 per cent in the south-eastern Pacific; between 78 per cent and 87 per cent in the north-western Pacific, the eastern central Pacific, the western central Pacific; and at 73.5 per cent in the eastern Indian Ocean and 67 per cent in the western Indian Ocean – which, as a consequence, have become attractive hubs for Chinese fishery. The European Union has included the governance of fisheries and the fight against IUU fishing on the agenda of its future strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. If the agenda is partly normative – as suggested by the negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference on the Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction – the EU’s Indo-Pacific policy should prioritise the reinforcement of fisheries management capacities in the region. This would help China’s neighbours regain control of their exclusive economic zones (EEZs). The EU has a remarkably strong position in all areas that would help it structure an effective and lasting system of fisheries management – from its influence on the norms of control to its export of ocean surveillance equipment, expertise, and capacity building. At a time when the EU is trying to contribute to maritime security more effectively, it has an opportunity to take an inclusive and non-politicised approach to fishery. Such an approach is sure to have a strategic impact, through the creation of effective multilateral coalitions that focus on these issues. This paper examines the reasons and policies that led China to become a threat to marine biodiversity, as well as its role in IUU fishing. The paper also analyses China’s use of its fishing fleet to achieve its strategic objectives and examines the overall impact of Chinese fisheries policies on Europe’s interests. Finally, it identifies some potential directions for a proactive European policy on fisheries in the Indo-Pacific. With the largest population of any nation, China far outstrips other countries as the world’s top fish producer (including fishery and aquaculture). China’s fishery activities rose by 15.6 per cent between 2005 and 2016. It accounts for 15 per cent of global marine captures, while the second-biggest producers, Peru and Indonesia, account for 8 per cent of the captures each. China operates the largest fleet of trawlers globally and heavily supports it with subsidies, 94 per cent of which comprise fuel subsidies. This enables Chinese industrial trawlers to fish in all the world’s oceans, including the Atlantic and Indian oceans – where, legally and illegally, the fishing industry provides a way for Beijing to establish a presence on the African coast. The fleet has expanded considerably in the past few years, whereas that of other major fishing countries has stabilised or declined. The added stress on fish stocks can, therefore, be partially attributed to China’s expansion. Paradoxically, China’s commitment to preserving and restoring its own fish stocks has made it a threat to the sustainable management of fishery resources around the world. The period from Mao Zedong’s assumption of power to the early 1980s was characterised by absurd levels of overfishing of Chinese fish stocks, which showed signs of depletion as early as the 1950s. In the early 1980s, there was a collapse in the populations of certain commercially fished species in these stocks. A decade of reforms followed, marked by the joint implementation of proactive policies for the protection and restoration of coastal resources, as well as the promotion of distant-water fishing. The former included the creation of closed areas and seasons in which fishing was banned; fishing moratoriums; the delimitation of protected areas; limits on the maximum size of nets; and minimum size requirements for meshes, to prevent nets from catching juvenile fish. The latter provided opportunities for Chinese trawlers to sell a part of their catch in foreign markets, buy diesel at subsidised prices, and benefit from a change in capital depreciation rates and various fiscal incentives. China has expanded each of these policies over time; for instance, subsidies for distant-water fishing rose considerably, peaking at $6.5 billion in 2013 and remaining steady (in principle) until 2015. The situation changed somewhat in 2016 with the announcement of the 13th Five-Year Plan. This dichotomy between seas under Chinese sovereignty and distant waters only increased with China’s incorporation of international environmental standards into its national legislation. With Beijing’s responsibility stopping at the limits of its EEZ, the process served its national goals without restricting Chinese activities abroad. In 1996 the State Oceanic Administration published ‘China’s Ocean Agenda 21’, which incorporated: the principles on the sustainable development of fish stocks enumerated in ‘Agenda 21’, which was issued at the conclusion of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Conference in Rio; and those enunciated in 1995 by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization in its ‘Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries’. The same year, China extended its environmental standards to its EEZs. In 2000 the country bolstered them by establishing quotas and expanding the fishing vessels licensing system it had set up in 1979. The implementation of these internal restrictions inevitably had a negative impact on China’s fisheries and its fishermen’s livelihoods. This led the State Council to launch the ‘Programme of Action on Conservation of Living Aquatic Resources’ and to establish ‘National Fisheries Five-Year Plans’, which emphasised food security and encouraged Chinese fishing enterprises to seek and exploit economic opportunities abroad. Nonetheless, these steps did not allow China to achieve its objectives with regard to supply, as much of the catch was sold off on foreign markets. The simultaneous introduction of these constraints led to, among other things, a reduction in the total volume of catches from 15m tonnes in 2016 to 10m tonnes in 2020. (The constraints involved the establishment of administrative systems for managing marine resources, prioritising sustainable use, conserving fishery resources, and protecting biodiversity). However, it is important to assess the fishery measures China initiated under the 13th Five-Year Plan from the viewpoint of their outcomes. During the first nine months of 2017, ‘domestic’ catches fell by 11.9 per cent, while those of distant-water fishing rose by 14.2 per cent; the total catch fell by 7.7 per cent over the whole year. In reality, while China seems to have considerably reduced subsidies for domestic fishery, it has not reduced those for distant-water fishing. China committed to reducing its domestic fishery subsidies by 40 per cent in 2020, but declared that up to 3,000 vessels could be involved in deep-sea fishing, and (like Russia) continued to oppose the expansion of marine protected areas. As the Chinese fleet numbered around 2,500 vessels, the new limitation amounted to a de facto authorisation of an increase in its size. In this context, the massive scale of China’s IUU fishing operations is a consequence of the dichotomy between domestic and distant-water fishing, and the depletion of national resources forcing Chinese fishermen to turn to deep-sea fishing.As a 2015 Greenpeace report stated, overfishing on the high seas and in foreign EEZs was a common practice for Chinese vessels. Indeed, numerous incidents in the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the East China Sea, and the South Atlantic Ocean testify to this. In the three main categories of ‘The Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing Index’ published in January 2019 – vulnerability, prevalence, and response – China ranked in place first place globally. Although Chinese researchers acknowledge this problem, they hold the fishermen – who are often poorly trained and unable to communicate with foreign authorities – partly responsible. They point to the progress China has made in training crews (including on the Law of the Sea and various regulations governing fishing), providing vessels with electronic equipment, and raising fines for violations of the rules. They do not deny the weakness of China’s management mechanisms, which erode the credibility of its efforts in these areas. However, one cannot absolve the Chinese state of its responsibilities. In 2016 Beijing officially strengthened sanctions for the contravention of international fishing regulations, and envisaged a revision of its fishing laws to add a system for blacklisting vessels involved in IUU fishing. Furthermore, in July 2018, China signed a partnership agreement with the EU on global governance of the oceans that involved combating IUU fishing (and which enabled China to export its fishery production to the European market). However, China is yet to join the Port State Measures Agreement, which was signed in 2009 and came into effect in 2016. Countries that sign the deal are required to check the registration of vessels before allowing them to dock; conduct inspections and take all necessary measures to ensure that these ships are not transporting illegally caught fish; and share information on all this between port states in real time, thereby casting an electronic net over pirate ships. Moreover, several major fishing agreements China has signed with African states call into question its sincerity about addressing these problems. They seem to indicate that Beijing primarily seeks to build a facade of legality around practices whose motives and consequences remain unchanged. According to Greenpeace, Chinese fishing companies – which are dependent on the state – regularly underreport the size of their vessels, sometimes by as much as 60 per cent, to obtain cheaper licences. This also enables them to haul in much larger volumes of fish than permitted and to carry on fishing in areas formally reserved for smaller ships. China’s fisheries policy shapes a strategic landscape in which appropriating resources is as important as protecting sea lanes. There is nothing new in states’ use of fishermen as occasional – and more or less willing – instigators of territorial conflicts. Nonetheless, China has gone much further than most by making its fleet of trawlers a weapon that serves its revisionist agenda. To this end, China uses its flotilla of fishing vessels as an unofficial militia, with its navy’s backing, and subsidises fishing in disputed waters – often those with scant fish stock – to assert its territorial claims. A series of incidents in the South China Sea since mid-2019 illustrates this: These incidents cast a new light on the South China Sea’s importance to international security. Added to the various classic issues on the delimitation of EEZs is the competition for an increasingly rare resource. Although the South China Sea accounted for 12 per cent of global catches in 2015, more than 50 per cent of the global fishing fleet operated in this region. As such, this competition transformed – with striking swiftness – the strategic maritime landscape into one in which economic actors, the fishermen, are no longer just instigators of territorial conflicts but unofficial sea militias. As one of Beijing’s main weapons in its disputes in the South China Sea, these militias receive support from the Chinese navy only when they need backup. Put another way, China uses its fishing fleet as the third arm of its navy. The massive presence of trawlers around the Chinese outposts of Subi and Mischief in the Spratly Islands reflects this new role. Indeed, the Pentagon declared in its 2017 ‘Annual Report to Congress on Military Developments in China’ that the country is “building a state-owned fishing fleet for its maritime militia force in the South China Sea”. By sending its fishing fleet into disputed waters, China can use these vessels as an excuse to deploy its coastguard and warships to defend its fishing vessels and back its territorial claims. China’s distinction between domestic waters, which must be protected, and international ones, which can be plundered, combine with its claim to almost 80 per cent of the South China Sea. As other South China Sea littoral states recognise, China uses its measures to preserve fish stocks as instruments to bolster these claims. In 1999 China unilaterally decreed a seasonal fishing moratorium in this zone. All other littoral states understood the move as China’s attempt to assert its sovereignty over these waters, and hence rejected the moratorium. In this context, these states see the presence of the US Navy in the region as an important security guarantee, given that most of them do not individually possess the assets necessary for confronting the Chinese navy if the situation escalated over fishing disputes. But the US presence also increases strategic polarisation and the risk of conflict in the region, as all sides may see escalation as easier to manage than in classic territorial disputes involving only state actors and their naval assets. Many European states could be tempted to consider China’s fisheries practices as a regrettable yet distant phenomenon with little or no impact on their interests. Yet control of fisheries is, as discussed, part of a new strategic landscape in which the appropriation of resources combines with the rapid militarisation of the oceans. As such, this has direct and indirect consequences for European interests. Indirectly, the predatory nature of China’s fishing could destabilise many regions along the sea lines of communication that are vital to European trade. Piracy off the Somali coast between 2005 and 2012 resulted from overfishing in Somali waters and fishermen’s need for an alternative source of income as the Somali state collapsed, before evolving into a form of organised crime. China was not responsible for the depletion of fish stocks in Somali waters, but reports by the Madagascar Regional Maritime Information Fusion Centre regularly raise Chinese IUU fishing off the coast of Africa and in the Indian Ocean generally. Moreover, China seized the opportunity created by the chaos in Somalia to establish a presence on the strait of Bab al-Mandeb, through the construction of a huge military base in Djibouti. The current fishing-related tensions in the South China Sea contribute to an atmosphere of strong political and strategic polarisation, as well as Indo-Pacific states’ very real concerns about food security. They illustrate the potential for China’s fisheries policy to generate conflict in and around the chokepoints between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. In Africa, the stakes may be different given that China has no direct territorial claims, but fishing plays no less of a strategic role – particularly in light of the country’s assertion of its presence in the Mozambique Channel, whose importance partly stems from the vulnerabilities of the Suez Canal (as recently highlighted by the stranding of the container ship Ever Given). The risk here is that China will gradually gain control of the African coast, which is of growing international importance due to the continent’s status as a future centre of economic growth. Some European states are more vulnerable than others, due to their territorial presence in parts of the Indo-Pacific. In Madagascar, Chinese fisheries policies directly threaten French interests in the region. In the Pacific, the indirect effects of China’s overfishing in the South China Sea, which pushed Vietnamese fishermen to seek their livelihoods in the waters of New Caledonia, are well documented. One can see the effects of this today: China’s fishing has spurred a wave of protests in French Polynesia, with demonstrators accusing Chinese vessels of operating illegally and demanding that they be banned from catching tuna. More broadly, China has shown a willingness to dilute France’s presence and influence in both the Indian and Pacific oceans. Lastly, it is possible that China will directly implement its strategy of occupying terrain with its fishing flotilla in other fish-rich regions in the Pacific. China’s fisheries policy is in direct opposition to Europe’s aims to protect biodiversity, particularly marine biodiversity, and creates precedents of a Chinese presence that the country can later use for political and strategic purposes. Of course, China is not the only state to push its fleets to engage in illegal fishing or to contribute to overfishing. Nonetheless, it has done so on the largest scale by far. China is one of the very few countries to have made fisheries part of the public sector and, above all, to have established a fishing arm of its navy to serve its strategic interests. China has profoundly transformed the maritime strategic landscape and complicated the nature of the potential response by positioning fishermen – commercial actors – to face the armed forces of states that dispute its claims to various economic zones. Moreover, China’s importance in the fishing industry has made it both a vital actor in any attempt to regulate the sector and a major obstacle to the extension of conservation measures, such as those to protect marine areas. The scale of China’s violations of existing regulations calls into question the sincerity of its commitment to them and the scientific and economic rationale for its actions, since it has simultaneously encouraged the protection of its national resources and the plunder of foreign waters. These considerations call for responses that vary across geographical areas but are all designed to help smaller Indo-Pacific states regain control of their territorial waters. The key problem in the Indo-Pacific is less the lack of regional organisations specifically dedicated to fisheries (or a broader purpose) than an inability to enforce existing regulations. This regrettable situation opens up considerable space for fisheries management. Europe can contribute to such management by delinking negotiations on international fisheries – and, more broadly, marine biodiversity protection, in which China is a legitimate and vital actor – from those on measures to enforce states’ sovereignty over their territorial waters. As the EU is a leader on marine biodiversity issues and a source of expertise on satellite and radar technology, as well as ocean governance, it is ideally placed to play a defining role on fisheries. Indeed, the bloc understands the need for the sustainable use of marine biological resources in the Indo-Pacific. On 16 April 2021, the European Council stated that the “EU strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific” should include “EU membership and active participation in relevant fisheries bodies, including Regional Seas Conventions and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, and the creation of Sustainable Fisheries Partnerships … and by tackling Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing”. This should, in turn, “contribute towards improved fisheries governance and coastal development in … partner countries”. However, it remains to be seen whether member states will provide the resources required to translate this statement of intent into actual policy. The EU already has an international fisheries policy that falls within the ambit of the Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG-MER). However, it lacks a significant presence in the Indo-Pacific. The EU conducts training for coastguards in the South China Sea with Vietnam and Indonesia. It also combats IUU fishing by conditioning access to its market on compliance with regulations on this matter. Moreover, its maritime surveillance programmes CRIMARIO I and II (Critical Maritime Routes in the Indian Ocean) in the south-western Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal respectively make it a credible actor in regional fisheries management. And EU member states engage in regional cooperation to combat IUU fishing. The Netherlands works with Thailand to this end. Nonetheless, there is a declining number of bilateral agreements on fishing between the EU and Indo-Pacific countries. Comoros, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Madagascar, Micronesia, Mozambique, Seychelles, and Solomon Islands benefited from such agreements until 2010, which enabled them to receive fisheries development aid in exchange for granting EU countries the right to access their EEZs. As of today, only the protocols signed with Seychelles and Cook Islands remain valid. Moreover, the EU lacks a law enforcement mechanism in the region. On 25 January 2021, the EU launched its Coordinated Maritime Presence (CMP) mechanism, a concept designed to create a permanent presence in – and prompt outreach to – maritime areas of interest, share information and analysis on these areas, and promote international cooperation and partnership at sea. The CMP mechanism was launched as a pilot project in the Gulf of Guinea, and there is a French proposal to replicate it in the Indian Ocean – where it would have been an effective instrument for enforcing IUU fishing regulation. But, so far, the idea has met with significant reluctance from several member states. And the mechanism would only be effective if there was some form of cooperation between the European External Action Service (whose responsibility for maritime security would put it in charge of the CMP) and DG-MER (which oversees fisheries policy). At times, the institutional cultures of the two bodies seem irreconcilable. It would also make sense to systematically include fisheries management on the agenda of the EU’s maritime security dialogues with its Indo-Pacific partners. As stated earlier, sovereignty over EEZs is central to the issue of IUU fishing. Indeed, control of fisheries is part of a new strategic landscape in which the appropriation of resources combines with the rapid militarisation of the oceans. This approach would facilitate better coordination between Europe and its partners in international negotiations related to, or directly or indirectly affecting, fisheries. It would have the same effect on capacity building in littoral states of the Indo-Pacific. No EU member state or like-minded partner has the resources to single-handedly conduct the various forms of training this would require (maritime surveillance, coastguard activity, and customs). Therefore, it makes sense for them to coordinate with one another to avoid duplication of effort. The EU could then amplify these actions in all relevant regional organisations in which it intended to make its presence felt. It would be relatively easy to include fisheries management in these dialogues, because the resources employed for the purpose are essentially the same as those for other sectors of maritime security. This is especially true of maritime surveillance, which European states are already working to expand to other countries. Given the importance of fisheries management to South China Sea littoral countries – in terms of sovereignty as much as economic development or food security – this issue could be a major theme for the EU to focus on in talks with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The union should include the development of fisheries on the agenda of its initiatives for Indo-Pacific cooperation. China’s attempts to dominate fisheries in the region often rely on the management of strategically important areas of the market (such as supply chains). By helping local stakeholders regain control of these areas, the EU would reduce China’s influence. It would also allow for a more comprehensive definition of maritime security and, consequently, for more EU member states to contribute to the effort in line with their own capacities. The EU should incorporate scientific collaboration into this cooperation with Indo-Pacific states. Many of these countries lack the means to assess their fish stocks or account for the need to preserve this resource in the framing and implementation of their fisheries policies, particularly those for issuing licences. The gradual extension of scientific cooperation to new partners would help the EU establish its legitimacy and influence in this field, by placing it at the core of this mechanism. It would also be astute of the EU to increase the transparency of fisheries management by supporting the relevant international NGOs. These organisations monitor compliance with the international norms governing fisheries as an aspect of maritime environmental protection and, above all, do not have the inhibitions of states in speaking up about China’s or others’ violations. This support could take the form of high-profile international conferences in which, alongside all major stakeholders in the fishing industry, they would be given space to express themselves. With the same outlook, the EU should encourage Indo-Pacific littoral states to make their activities on fisheries part of the Fisheries Transparency Initiative. This global initiative endeavours to bring together governments, the fishing industry, and civil society organisations to verify and publish complete data on the fisheries sector (including terms of access agreements, details of payments made by ships and foreign investors, information on new investments, and data on catches). The publicity provided by these assessments would help civil society groups– such as fishermen’s professional organisations –protect their interests from foreign states’ predatory behaviour, adding weight to their argumentson the larger issue of China’s violation of international regulations. Though fisheries management (and aquaculture) is vital to the preservation of marine biodiversity, it does not appear on either the agenda of COP15 or the conference of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. If fishery is important enough to be dealt with by the EU and key international measures such as World Trade Organization subsidies, it is logical to include the issue on the agendas of biodiversity conservation organisations. This would allow NGOs, among others, to join the debate. The good governance of fisheries is a crucial element of a global order based on adherence to international law, particularly the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. But, as reflected in French initiatives in the Indo-Pacific, it is also important to protect the fishery resources of overseas territories and, through these, the EU’s sovereign interests and strategic positioning. Europe cannot be a bystander on this issue just because China is a rising military power in the region. Not only is the predatory nature of Chinese fishing policies in direct opposition to European objectives to protect marine biodiversity, but control of the Mozambique Channel – and the need to prevent political and strategic polarisation in the region similar to that in the South China Sea – is vital to European interests. Moreover, Europeans cannot ignore the potentially destabilising effects of China’s fisheries policy on Indo-Pacific littoral states. Europe paid most of the cost of the fight against piracy off the coast of Somalia, which was a consequence of overfishing before it became an organised crime issue. Beijing took advantage of this to legitimise its presence in the Indian Ocean and establish a military base in Djibouti. China is now contributing to overfishing along the entire eastern and southern African coast. And its role in anti-piracy operations was limited to the protection of Chinese ships. In other words, China is creating the conditions for the reappearance of piracy while pushing the costs of it onto Europeans. Furthermore, the EU should show that cooperation with China as part of negotiations on biodiversity can complement pressure on the country to change its behaviour in the fisheries sector. Biodiversity negotiations would yield international norms that made it easier for the EU to hold Beijing to account for this behaviour, as Chinese decision-makers would be involved in drawing up agreements produced by the talks. European capacity building in Indo-Pacific littoral states would help them ensure that China complied with the resulting norms, thereby helping protect the EU’s interests. This would also create an opportunity to mobilise states around a common interest – whose importance will only grow as food insecurity rises, and which has ramifications far beyond the fisheries sector itself. By forming coalitions on fisheries management, the EU could develop an approach to China that turns on not just political considerations but also the common interests that may arise in the field. The union could develop these coalitions to help bind China with a series of technical constraints that the country helped create. This would, in turn, help the EU not only sustain its influence in the Indo-Pacific but also redefine the terms of its discussions with China while avoiding confrontation.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Bing,"Asinara, two divers caught with ten kilos of fish in a protected area: complaint and seizure triggered"," Poaching in the waters of the Asinara national park .  Last night two underwater fishermen were surprised by the Coast Guard while they were fishing inside the general reserve Zone B called ""Punta Barbarossa"" . The two divers, on board a boat, were found in possession of approximately ten kilos of fish of various species and technical equipment used for underwater fishing .  The sport fishermen were reported to the Judicial Authority with the seizure of their catch and all the material used for the illicit activity. The operation is part of a surveillance and protection activity carried out in the waters of the Asinara Marine Protected Area.  After a long and complex investigation and information gathering activity, a fast naval unit of the Coast Guard - specialized in police activities - under the Port Authority of Porto Torres, intercepted the suspicious vessel, along the coast of park island. One of the areas in which the fishing ban is in force, prefigured as a crime due to the particular protection to which marine protected areas are subject, considered of exceptional importance for the correct protection of the marine-coastal habitat in areas of particular naturalistic value.  The seized catch , following health certification by the veterinarians of the ASL of Sassari who deemed it suitable for human consumption, was donated to charity to a non-profit organization in Porto Torres involved in child reception and recovery activities .

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Bing,"6 rescued by Coast Guard after boat catches fire, sinks in Lake Tahoe, California sheriff says"," Six people aboard a motorboat in Lake Tahoe were rescued Sunday by the U.S. Coast Guard after the vessel caught fire and sank. Placer County deputies were alerted to the fire about 1:50 p.m. near Cedar Flat, an unincorporated community on Lake Tahoe’s northwest shore. Deputies arrived to the boat — traditionally used for wakeboarding or wake surfing — fully engulfed in flames as heavy smoke billowed across the waters. The passengers aboard were “safe with no major injuries,” the Sheriff’s Office said. Deputies and firefighters with the North Tahoe Fire Protection District sprayed water onto the boat, but its hull suffered too much damage and sank, deputies said on social media.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Bing,Peruvian authorities implement “laughable” fine against Chinese IUU vessel," Search Share    A Chinese vessel caught illegally fishing in Peru’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) has only suffered a small punishment for its actions, with Peruvian authorities fining the infringing vessel PEN 242 (USD 65, EUR 60). The negligible sanction on the Tian Xiang vessel provoked the ire of Peru’s National Society of Artisanal Fishing (Sonapescal), which called the penalty “laughable” and said the fine does not repair the environmental damage caused by the vessel or discourage future vessels from fishing illegally. In 2023, more than 150 foreign vessels entered Peru’s EEZ without using the satellite devices required by Peruvian law for fishing activities; so far this year, the total has reached 35, according to Sonapescal. What makes the situation especially tough to swallow, according to the organization, is that Peruvian officials often charge heavy fines to small-scale fishers caught under the same circumstances. “[Authorities] impose exorbitant fines on artisanal fishermen, initiate criminal proceedings against us, freeze our bank accounts, and confiscate our boats and fishing equipment,” Sonapescal Vice President Edwin Houghton told La República. Peru’s Ministry of Production (PRODUCE), which oversees the country’s fishing activity, has acknowledged the country's fishing regulations need to be revised in order to deter illegal activity. According to Sonapescal, four more foreign ships were improperly authorized to enter Peruvian waters in May, despite not having the proper tracking devices as mandated by supreme decree 016-2016-PRODUCE. All four vessels – Ning Tai 11, Zhou Yu 908, Pu Yuan 827, and Hua Ying 78 – have a history of illegal activity and labor abuse, Sonapescal said. The association has asked the Ministry of Defense and PRODUCE to intensify inspections of foreign vessels entering Peru’s exclusive economic zone. South American countries have had issues with foreign fleets fishing illegally in their national waters for years. The U.S. has recently sought to aid South American governments with deterrence of illegal fishing in the region, which is estimated to cost them and South American companies billions of dollars in revenue annually.    Become a  Premium member to  unlock the rest of this article.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Bing,"Limitations on the snow crab catch, new condition for Norwegian vessels"," Minister of Fisheries and Ocean Policy, Marianne Sivertsen Næss NFD The Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Fisheries in Norway is implementing new conditions for participation in snow crab fishing to ensure ""better profitability"". It would be a developed measure already implemented in December 2023. According to Fisheries and Ocean Minister Marianne Sivertsen Næss, through rigorous participation, ""fewer participants will provide more predictability for the operators and limit the environmental impact caused by abandoned and lost gear in the sea."" Prior, the petition for a participation limit was consulted and according to the Ministry, almost all agents agreed on its implementation. Thus, the ministry decided that the measure would come into effect on January 1, 2025. Precisely, participation is limited by requiring activity in the catch during two of the qualifying years (2020, 2021, 2022 until May 16). Investors can apply for exemptions. Finally, the recall decision will be notified to all vessel owners and permits will disappear. Also, new conditions for snow crab permits will be communicated. The new conditions will take effect immediately so that the process of handling applications for new snow crab permits can begin. Additionally, agreements between vessels with a new snow crab permit and the land-based industry will be encouraged. To this end, it has been decided that 10% of the total snow crab quota will be set aside for the delivery of live snow crab starting in 2025. Vessels will apply to harvest this raw material when collaborating with the industry. Regarding this measure, the Minister explained: ""I am committed to stimulating more activity on land, and I will see if earmarking raw material can contribute. At the same time, we must ensure the profitability of the vessels, and it is necessary to make adjustments in line with new operating patterns."" In April, the Norwegian snow crab fishery obtained Marine Stewardship Council certification due to stock status, ecosystem impact, and management practices. Follow Us © 2024 We Are Aquaculture.

Vessel caught underreporting catch near protected area,Bing,"Two explosions near vessel off Yemen's coast, UK maritime office says",,3 days ago
Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Google,Canadian atlantic swordfish and other tuna," The purpose of this Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) is to identify the main objectives and requirements for the swordfish and other tunas (Albacore, bigeye, yellowfin) fishery in Atlantic Canada, as well as the tactics that will be used to achieve these objectives. This document also serves to communicate the basic information on the fishery and its management to staff of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), legislated co-management boards and other stakeholders. This IFMP provides a common understanding of the basic “rules” for the sustainable management of the fisheries resource. Through IFMPs, DFO Maritimes Region intends to implement an Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM) across all marine fisheries. The approach considers impacts extending beyond those affecting the target species and, in this respect, is consistent with the Food and Agriculture Organizationâs Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Implementation will take place in a step by step, evolutionary way, building on existing management processes. Advances will be made incrementally, beginning with the highest priorities and issues that offer the greatest scope for progress. A summary of the EAM framework is included as Appendix 1 to the IFMP. This IFMP is not a legally binding instrument that can form the basis of a legal challenge. The IFMP can be modified at any time and does not fetter the Minister's discretionary powers set out in the Fisheries Act. The Minister can, for reasons of conservation or for any other valid reasons, modify any provision of the IFMP in accordance with the powers granted pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Where DFO is responsible for implementing obligations under land claims agreements, the IFMP will be implemented in a manner consistent with these obligations. In the event that an IFMP is inconsistent with obligations under land claims agreements, the provisions of the land claims agreements will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

            Table 23: ICAAT Swordfish Quota and Allocations
            Table 24: Compliance Risks and Mitigating Strategies The Atlantic swordfish fishery began commercially in the late 1880s as harpoon sailing vessels fished swordfish throughout Atlantic Canada and eventually expanded their fishery along the annual migration patterns of the eastern seaboard of North America. In the early 1960s, the Atlantic swordfish fishery shifted from a harpoon to primarily a longline fishery and landings increased to a high of approximately 8,000t. Recorded landings decreased sharply in 1970. North Atlantic swordfish and tuna stocks come under the stewardship of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). ICCAT is the Regional Fisheries Management Organization responsible for the management of tunas and other highly migratory species in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. While the Commission was established in 1969, the first specific ICCAT measures for the north Atlantic swordfish stock were not put in place until 1991, when countries were required to limit their annual catch by 15% less than their 1988 harvest levels. Minimum fish sizes were also put into place at that time. The Commissionâs recommendation resulted in Canada reducing its annual harvest and introducing domestic measures to limit the harvesting of undersized swordfish. The first national allocations to ICCAT Contracting Parties were made for 1995 and went to those member countries with a history of fishing swordfish, namely Canada, the USA, Spain and Portugal. Japan, whose swordfish catches are a by-catch in other tuna fisheries, was restricted to 8% of their total north Atlantic catch of tunas. Japan has received a specific annual quota amount since 1997. Also, beginning that year, a small quota was put aside for the United Kingdom, on behalf of its overseas territories (primarily Bermuda) and a small amount was set aside for ""Other"" contracting parties (see Table 23). Starting in 2003, swordfish quota under the ""Other"" category was fully assigned to an additional nine countries. Also in 2003, ICCAT approved a substantial increase to the total allowable catch (TAC), including discards of north Atlantic swordfish, to 14,000t in 2003 from 10,400t the previous year, including discards. This increase was a result of improved stock status under the 10-year rebuilding plan that was initiated in 2000. In the period of 1995 to 2000, further reductions in the Canadian quota on an annual basis resulted in the need for significant changes to our swordfish management strategy. Significant changes in the management strategy were implemented under the 2000-2002 Swordfish Plan, and they hinged on fleet allocations to each of the harpoon and swordfish longline fleets. In addition, the swordfish longline fishery implemented a number of measures under their Conservation Harvesting Plan (CHP) designed to reorient effort toward other tunas within their fleet allocation. In 2002, these management measures were further refined with the introduction of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQ) to the longline fleet on a trial basis, and permanently in 2003. From 2003 to 2009 the quota remained at 14,000t. In 2009 an assessment of the stock was completed and stated that the stock had been rebuilt to 99.9% of the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). However, the TAC was reduced to 13,700t for 2010 - 2012 for precautionary reasons. There are two commercial gear types (longline and harpoon) permitted in this fishery that takes place in the waters off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. With the close relationship in catches for the longline fishery between pelagics this is, in effect, a multi-species fishery with catch authorized through licence conditions. Swordfish longline licence conditions are used in conjunction with licence conditions for the other tunas and together identify the authorized directed species as well as the large number of permitted by-catch species (sharks, marlins and other tunas). Entry to the swordfish fishery, regardless of fleet sector, is limited to the current licences and has been since 1992. Licences have been fixed at this number, but may be reissued, within certain policy restrictions, from one fisher to another. Since 2000 the Department facilitated a transfer process to provide First Nations with Swordfish licenses. As a result of this process there have been 9 licence transfers to Aboriginal people â with no transfers since 2004. All communal commercial fisheries licences are held in the name of the band. In most recent years, approximately 50-55 of the 77 licences have been active in any given year and are authorized to operate a longline fishing operation Atlantic-wide. A unique offshore tuna licence introduced in 2000, is based in the Maritimes Region and also operates a longline fishing operation Atlantic-wide but primarily directs for tunas. The pelagic longline licences are transferable Atlantic-wide, and the other tunas licences are non-separable from the swordfish longline licences. Principal ports of landing in the Atlantic Region include Shelburne, Sambro, Woods Harbour and Clarks Harbour in Nova Scotia, and St. John's and Fermeuse in Newfoundland & Labrador. Pelagic longline vessels are also licensed to fish with harpoon gear, but since 2000, any landings by harpoon gear are attributed to the longline quota. All longline licence holders are represented by the Nova Scotia Swordfishermen's Association (NSSA), which is based in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, with the exception of the offshore tuna longline licence which is represented by its owner/managers directly. Historically the Harpoon A licence holders fished competitively and between 2005 and 2010, there were 60-74 active licences each year representing a total of 118 different licence holders of the 184 licences within Group A that make dedicated trips for swordfish. The Harpoon B licence holders do not make swordfish dedicated trips but have a licence that allows them to harpoon a swordfish on an opportunistic basis while harvesting other species. Principal ports of landing in Nova Scotia include Shelburne, Cape Sable Island, Sambro, Woods Harbour and Clarks Harbour. Interest in the fishery remains along the eastern shore of Nova Scotia and in northeastern Cape Breton, but there were few active licences (i.e. during the years 1996-1999) in those areas of the Province. Gulf Region licences are primarily used by fishers from the Gulf, fishing opportunistically on swordfish while directing for bluefin tuna in waters off Nova Scotia. Starting in 2001, a small number of fishers based primarily in Cape Breton and including some Gulf-based swordfish harpoon licence holders coordinated their own Conservation and Harvesting Plan (CHP) for the 4Vn area. Until 2009 the majority of the recently active harpoon-only licence holders were represented by the Swordfish Harpoon Association (SHA), which is based on the south shore of Nova Scotia. In 2010 some of the Harpoon A licence holders were represented by the Swordfish Harpoon Quota Society (SHQ), which is also based in Nova Scotia. Membership increased so that in 2012 this group represented 140 licence holders. The SHA was not active as an association and the remaining licence holders did not actively fish in 2012. The SHQ supported the introduction of an Individual Quota (IQ) system in an attempt to address the ârace for the fishâ which occurred under the competitive strategy resulting in quota being caught in a short period of time resulting in a glut on the market. It was hoped this flexibility would add value to the fishery and to the licenses themselves. This community based allocation system, coordinated by the SHQ, was introduced as a voluntary pilot in 2011 and approved as a permanent option in 2012. This fishery extends from Georges Bank south of Nova Scotia to beyond the Flemish Cap east of Newfoundland when swordfish, the main species targeted, migrate into and adjacent to the Canadian Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Longline fishing effort generally progresses from west to east and back again and from offshore to inshore along the edge of the continental shelf following swordfish movements associated with seasonal warming trends of surface water temperature, and a northward movement of the edge of the Gulf Stream. Harpooning for swordfish currently occurs primarily along the edges of Georges and Browns Banks, and targets mainly the large female swordfish ""basking"" in surface waters during the day. The fishery is managed using either ITQs or competitive fishing, with DFO controlling the fishery in order to keep it within the Canadian quota allocated by ICCAT. Both active fleets, harpoon and longline, in the Canadian fishery continue to push for the implementation of long-term objectives and decision making consistent with Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). A MSC's fishery certification and seafood ecolabel recognises fisheries that follow sustainable fishing practices. This requires that harvesting practices do not lead to overfishing, allow potential recovery of a depleted stock and maintain the ecosystem on which the fishery depends. More information can be found at: http://www.msc.org The Canadian large pelagic longline fisheries that direct for, or incidentally catch, swordfish operate from April through December, though the season can extend year round subject to quota availability. To date vessels capable of fishing the winter season have focused on other fisheries in the January to March period. In 2002, an ITQ management strategy was introduced and has proved successful. The maximum concentration of quota through permanent transfers that can be held by any individual licence holder is limited to 5% of the fleetâs quota. There is no limit on the amount of temporary quota. In order to meet market demand for harpooned swordfish, a transport licence was introduced in 2011 whereby harpooned swordfish from a longline licence could be transferred to a transport vessel and landed separately from the longline catch. Specific rules including tagging of the transferred fish, use of special monitoring and tally documents are required to meet this policy. The Canadian swordfish fishery continues to push for the implementation of long-term objectives and decision making consistent with Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The longline fishery was MSC certified in April 19, 2012. The harpoon fishery for swordfish primarily occurs from June through late August. The quota is still fished competitively. However, it was subdivided into two quota groups beginning in the 2000-2002 Swordfish Management Plan: Group A comprises recently active licences while Group B includes all other licences. Recently active was defined as having at least one landed swordfish or hail out against the harpoon-only licence during any of the years 1996-1999 inclusive, documented with DFO. The harpoon fishery was MSC certified on June 8, 2010 and as with the longline fleet the harpoon fishery pushes for the implementation of long-term objectives and decision making consistent with MSC. For the 2011 introduction of the IQ program, individual licence shares were calculated by 90% historical shares (total landings from 1998-2009) and 10% equal shares. Members of the fleet may choose to combine their allocations to fish under either an ITQ or a competitive regime. All licence holders within the competitive regime start fishing at the same time and stop once the quota is caught. Individual licence holders within the SHQ group may accumulate quota, up to a maximum limit of 10% of the fleetâs quota, and activity fish throughout the season within their individual quota limit. ICCAT, as the inter-governmental fishery organization responsible for the conservation of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean, coordinates scientific research and allocates quota to its members. These quotas are monitored by both the Department and industry separately. The industry consists of the main fisher Associations, the SHA, SHQ and the NSSA, on behalf of their respective memberships. These groups are part of the membership of the Scotia Fundy Large Pelagics Advisory Committee (SFLPAC) which meets at least once per year to discuss fisheries issues. Since the Maritimes Region houses most of the licence holders in both the harpoon and longline sectors, within SFLPAC, discussions and fishery recommendations for the Atlantic-wide fisheries involving swordfish and other tunas are developed under the chairmanship of the Senior Advisor Large Pelagics. Following that, input is provided, within an advisory forum, to the Atlantic Large Pelagics Advisory Committee (ALPAC) which provides representation to all regions and is chaired by national headquarters. ALPAC convenes twice yearly with industry representatives for all large pelagic fisheries. A late winter/early spring meeting focuses on management recommendations for the up-coming fishing season, taking into consideration evaluations from post season reviews, the objectives for the fishery and international commitments and obligations as a result of ICCAT decisions. Consultations in the fall provide advice to Canada's delegation to ICCAT. Working groups of the Advisory Committees may be struck to discuss and address specific issues. In the spring of 2010 an âEcosystem Working Groupâ was initiated under ALPAC to provide advice on ecosystem considerations in the large pelagic fisheries. In 2011 a working group provided input into the development of the IFMP led by the Maritimes Region Senior Advisor Large Pelagics for approval by the Maritimes Regional Director General and the national Director General Resource Management with subsequent presentation to the Minister. In addition to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT), CHPs specific to Swordfish and other tuna fleets and the IFMP, the fishery is governed by a suite of legislation, policy and regulations including but not limited to those noted below. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas is an inter-governmental fishery organization responsible for the conservation of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas. The Fisheries Act of Canada regulates all activities on inland waters and on the sea that could impact fish or fish habitat. General licensing and registration regulatory requirements are found in the Atlantic Fishery Regulations, 1985 (AFR), Part II. Part V applies to pelagic species and Section 50 of the AFR provides the regulations that govern Atlantic Canadaâs Swordfish fishery. Part X provides the regulations that apply to the tuna fishery. The Fishery General Regulations (FGR) provide guidance in managing fishing and related activities across Canada. Specific issues applicable to these fisheries that are covered under the FGRs include: licence conditions, the authority to issue variation orders to set minimum legal sizes and amend season dates, and control incidental catches in the fishery. With the introduction of the Gully Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2004, specific action includes a prohibition on pelagic longline fishing activity inside Zone 1 of the MPA to protect bottlenose whales from entanglement with longline gear. The Act is a key federal government commitment to prevent wildlife species from becoming extinct and secure the necessary actions for their recovery. It provides for the legal protection of wildlife species and the conservation of their biological diversity. With the promulgation of the Species at Risk Act (SARA) in June 2003, new management measures were required in support of the recovery of leatherback turtles. This impacted the swordfish and other tunas longline fishery as well as the offshore tuna licence - both of which were required to carry Incidental Harm Permits (IHP) effective June 1, 2004, the date after which prohibition commenced for this species, until finalization of a Leatherback Turtle Recovery Strategy. The Leatherback Recovery Strategy was finalized in 2006 and is due for re-evaluation in 2011. Under Section 83 of SARA, permits were no longer required as the Recovery Strategy addressed the incidental harm to leatherback turtles. Industry representatives from these fleets have actively participated in the recovery planning process and have already developed and implemented a Code of Conduct for Responsible Sea Turtle Handling and Mitigative Measures. Similar measures and processes may be required pursuant to SARA if other species for which there is known interaction with pelagic longline gear are declared at risk. Other species under SARA review for upcoming SARA or DFO listing decisions (current COSEWIC status) include loggerhead turtles (endangered), porbeagle shark (endangered), white shark (endangered), shortfin mako (threatened), basking shark (special concern), blue shark (special concern), and spiny shark (special concern). In 1999, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) adopted a voluntary IPOA for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries with the objective of encouraging countries to adopt national plans to reduce seabird by-catches where this was thought necessary. In April 2000, Canada hosted a workshop to discuss seabird incidental catch in the waters of Arctic countries. The general conclusion was that seabird by-catch is not an issue in the Canadian Atlantic pelagic longline fisheries. In 2007, Canada presented its National Plan of Action (NPOA) for reducing the incidental catch of seabirds within Canadian longline fisheries. Globally, the impact of Canadaâs longline fisheries on incidental catch of seabirds tends to be low. Nevertheless monitoring has been and continues to be implemented to assess seabird by-catch in longline fisheries. A copy of the plan can be found on the Fisheries and Oceans Canada website: at /npoa-pan/npoa-pan/npoa-seabirds-eng.htm. The FAO also adopted in 1999 a voluntary IPOA for shark conservation to address global overfishing. In 2007, Canada released its national plan for the conservation and management of sharks and their long-term sustainable use. The national plan identified that blue shark is the most commonly caught large shark in Canadian waters. It also stated: âIt is estimated that catch mortality within the total North Atlantic ranges between 26,000 and 32,000 tonnes for blue shark. These are considered to be low estimates, of which the Canadian portion is very small.â In addition, research suggests that blue shark have a high survival rate when handled properly. Therefore globally, the impact of Canadaâs fishing activities on shark populations tend to be low. Nevertheless, measures have been and continue to be implemented to improve the management of these species. Current management measures in the swordfish longline fishery that are pertinent to shark by-catch include: These measures are addressed under the Canadian Atlantic Shark Integrated Fisheries Management Plan â 2002-2007. This plan will be updated based on the review of the exploratory fisheries under the Emerging Fisheries Policy. A copy of the NPOA can be found on the Fisheries and Oceans Canada website: National plan of action for the conservation and management of sharks. In 2012 a report (Canadaâs Progress Report on the Implementation of Key Actions Pursuant to the National Plan of Action on the Conservation and Management of Sharks (March 2007)) was released indicating that Canada has made progress in a number of areas and is continuing with additional studies to improve knowledge on shark species. This report is available at National Plan of Action for the 
Conservation and Management of Sharks. Swordfish are exported fresh, in gutted head-off form. This is also the form in which most of the fish are landed, indicating a low value-added component in onshore processing of this species. The export values are very close to the landed values, indicating the high export component of the landings.
 Swordfish are distributed widely in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea, and range from Canada to Argentina on the western side, and from Norway to South Africa on the eastern side (Figure 1). Swordfish in the Atlantic Ocean are managed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) as three separate stocks: the North and South Atlantic, separated at 5ËN latitude, and the Mediterranean Sea. This stock separation is supported by recent genetic analysis; however, the precise boundaries between stocks are uncertain. Hence, it is important to have effective management measures throughout the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Adult swordfish have few natural predators with the possible exception of sharks. They feed on a wide variety of prey including groundfish, pelagics, deep-water fish and invertebrates. They are believed to feed throughout the water column, and undertake extensive vertical migrations. They are typically caught on pelagic longlines at night when they feed in surface waters or by harpoon during the day when they bask at the surface. The broad diet and habitat preference of swordfish make them very adaptable to changes in habitat. Swordfish spawn in warm tropical and subtropical waters throughout the year, although seasonality has been reported. They are found in the colder northern waters during summer months and are in Canadian waters from May to November, primarily on the edge of the Scotian Shelf and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Results from pop-up satellite archival tagging (PSAT) provide strong evidence of precise homing to the summer foraging grounds. Young swordfish grow very rapidly, reaching about 140 cm LJFL (lower jaw-fork length) by age 3, but grow slowly thereafter. Females grow faster than males and reach a larger maximum size. Swordfish are difficult to age, but 50% of females are considered mature by age 5. The latitudinal range of bigeye tuna is very wide, and these fish are considered to be at the northern limit of their range in Canadian waters. Considered a tropical and subtropical species, juvenile fish tend to disperse into temperate waters as they grow larger, and only larger fish are caught in Canadian waters. This resource is currently managed as a single Atlantic-wide stock. Yellowfin tuna are also considered a tropical/subtropical species. Yellowfin are managed as a single Atlantic-wide stock. In contrast with yellowfin and bigeye tunas, albacore tuna are found to a greater extent in temperate waters. The stock structure is similar to swordfish; northern and southern stocks are separated at 5ËN, and there is a separate Mediterranean stock. Swordfish are caught both in directed swordfish fisheries, and as a by-catch of the other tuna (bigeye, yellowfin, albacore) fisheries. They are also a by-catch of the shark longline fleet. Bluefin tuna, the other tunas and a variety of sharks are all by-catch in the swordfish longline fishery. As noted above, there are few natural predators of large swordfish, so predation has little influence on swordfish abundance. Swordfish fished in Atlantic Canada are part of the north Atlantic stock (Figure 1). Because of their migratory nature, swordfish are under the jurisdiction of ICCAT. Canada is one of 48 Contracting Parties at ICCAT. ICCAT compiles fishery statistics from its members, coordinates research and stock assessments, and develops scientific-based management advice. The management objective of ICCAT is to maintain quotas at the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Due to the highly migratory natuÂ¬re of swordfish and their high individual value, scientists rely primarily on data derived from the commercial fishery. Canada, as a member of ICCAT, is obligated to provide catch, estimates of swordfish discarded from the longline fleet, catch-at-size and catch per unit effort (CPUE) information annually to ICCAT. This information is used by ICCAT scientists to conduct stock assessments during the ICCATSwordfish Species Group meetings. Canada participates in the ICCAT stock assessment process. The draft advice of the ICCAT Swordfish Species Group is then peer reviewed by the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) which usually meets in October of each year. Once final, this advice in the form of an Executive Summary is presented to the Commission. In Canada, the scientific advice is presented to ALPAC between the meetings of the SCRS and the Commission (usually late October or early November). The ICCAT SCRS completes a full scientific evaluation of the swordfish and other tunas on a regularly scheduled basis, generally conducted every 3-4 years. The last full assessment of Atlantic swordfish stock was undertaken in 2009 which indicated that the stocks were fully rebuilt. While the stock continues to be monitored annually, the next full assessment of Atlantic swordfish is scheduled to be undertaken in 2012 in time for the Commissionâs annual meeting. The text that follows in this section has been extracted, with slight modification, from the most recent (2010) Executive Summary for North Atlantic Swordfish. The reports of the ICCAT SCRS for the various species can be found at: www.iccat.int. and the ICCAT Report for biennial period, 1998-99 Part II (1999) â Vol. 1, pp. 69-7199-2 can be found at: http://www.iccat.int/Documents/Recs/compendiopdf-e/1999-02-e.pdf For the past decade, the North Atlantic reported catch (landings + estimated dead discards) has averaged about 11,332t per year. The catch in 2009 (12,655t) represents a 37% decrease since the 1987 peak in North Atlantic landings (20,236t). The 2009 assessment indicated that the relative biomass (Figure 2A) trend shows a consistent increase since 2000, and indicates that the stock is at or above BMSY (Figure 2A). Fishing mortality (F) has been below FMSY since 2005. The results suggest that there is greater than 50% probability that the stock is at or above BMSY, and thus the Commissionâs rebuilding objective [99-2] has been achieved (Figure 2B). However, it is important to note that since 2003 the catches have been below the TACâs, greatly increasing the chances for a fast recovery. An updated estimate of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) from production model analyses is 13,730t (with estimates ranging from 13,020t to 14,182t). Future TACs above MSY are projected to result in 50% or lower probabilities of stock biomass remaining above BMSY over the next decade. A TAC of 13,000 t would provide approximately a 75% probability of maintaining the stock at a level consistent with the Convention Objective over the next decade. A. Estimated biomass relative to biomass at MSY (B/BMSY) for the period 1950-2009. Upper and lower lines represent approximate 80% confidence ranges. B. Future projections of B/BMSY under the constant catch scenarios listed. For the catch projection period (2005-2018), the upper line is the projected relative biomass at a constant catch of 10,000t and the lower line is the projected relative biomass at a constant catch of 15,000t (Source: 2010 SCRS Executive Summary, Atlantic Swordfish). The 2009 assessment for Albacore tuna in the North Atlantic region indicated that the stock has remained below BMSY since the late 1960s and that catches below 28,000t will be required for stock rebuilding. Catches in 2008 and 2009 were below that level and a TAC of 28,000t was recommended for 2010 and 2011. ICCAT recommended that the next assessment for northern albacore be scheduled for 2013. For bigeye tuna, the 2010 stock assessment indicated that the 2009 biomass was slightly above or below (72-134%) the biomass at MSY (BMSY). Catches in 2009 were 86,011t. Projections indicate that catches reaching 85,000 t or less will promote stock growth. ICCAT recommended that the next assessment for bigeye tuna be scheduled for 2014. The yellowfin tuna resource was last assessed in 2011, using catch and effort data through 2010. The 2006 biomass level was considered to be 85% of BMSY. Catches at that time were considered to be well below MSY levels, and maintenance of those catch levels is expected to lead to a biomass somewhat above BMSY by 2016. Canada continues to move forward with the implementation of the Precautionary Approach (PA) to management decisions for all fisheries resources including the North Atlantic swordfish and other tunas fishery. The precautionary approach is a decision making process with rules which identify triggers and responses during periods of changing stock health. Health of the stock is based on abundance and responses would normally reduce effort on the stock during periods of decreasing abundance or allow increased effort during periods of increased abundance. In general, the precautionary approach in fisheries management is about being cautious when scientific knowledge is uncertain, and not using the absence of adequate scientific information as a reason to postpone action or failure to take action to avoid serious harm to fish stocks or their ecosystem. This approach is widely accepted as an essential part of sustainable fisheries management. Applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management decisions entails establishing a harvest strategy that: Pre-agreed, risk-based actions will be designed to guide management decisions on harvest rates under various stock status conditions. In the healthy zone, the fish stock status is good, and fisheries management decisions and harvest strategies are designed to maintain fish stocks within this zone. In the cautious zone, decisions and strategies promote stock rebuilding to the healthy zone. In the critical zone, stock growth is promoted and removals are kept to the lowest possible level. Reference points are based on the productivity objectives of the fishery and can include biological, social and economic factors. Development of quantitative reference points requires data on the stock status and is often expressed as biomass, spawning biomass or abundance. Stock levels above the Upper Stock Reference Point are deemed to be in the âHealthy Zoneâ. If the stock level falls below the Upper Stock Reference Point, the stock has entered the âCautious zoneâ and harvest rate begins to be reduced. If the stock level falls below the Limit Reference Point, the stock has entered the âCritical Zoneâ and management must take serious measures to ensure stock rebuilding. The Removal Reference Point represents the maximum removal rate, often expressed as Fishing mortality (F) or exploitation rates. Exploitation rate is the ratio of all human removals to total exploitable stock size. The Target Reference Point is a stock level that may be greater than or equal to the Upper Reference Point for the fishery and is a level for the fishery that is considered to be desirable and at which management action should aim. This may take into greater account social and economic aspects of the fishery. In general ICCAT objectives for management of stocks are to maintain or rebuild stock status to a level of BMSY. Although currently there are no clear reference points or responses they are moving towards adopting management decisions based on the precautionary approach. Canada continues to pursue the use of the precautionary approach at ICCAT and was instrumental in moving this forward for north Atlantic swordfish. In the most recent management recommendation adopted by ICCAT, Canada insisted that two key clauses be included. âIn advance of the next assessment of North Atlantic swordfish, the SCRS (Standing Committee on Research and Statistics) shall develop a Limit Reference Point (LRP) for this stock.â âFuture decisions on the management of this stock shall include a measure that would trigger a rebuilding plan, should the biomass decrease to a level approaching the defined LRP as established by the SCRS."" Canada hosted an ICCAT precautionary approach workshop in April 2010 and continues to work within the ICCAT precautionary approach working group towards the adoption of this approach to the management of all ICCAT managed species. A primary focus of the research program on swordfish has been to improve the quality of the input information (catch, catch-at-size and effort) for the assessment, and to more fully understand the biology and behaviour of swordfish through cooperative (DFO Science and industry) tagging and fishing gear experiments. Research on swordfish depends very much upon cooperation from the fishing industry to gain access to fish for study, to collect detailed information and to seek input to improve the indices of relative abundance derived from commercial catch rate data. Mandatory submission of detailed log records, Dockside Monitoring, Observer coverage, and taking biologists aboard vessels are all part of the data collection scheme. An extensive PSAT research program began in 2005 with effort concentrated in the Georges Bank area. More recently, tagging effort has shifted to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. In collaboration with US scientists, Canada is examining pooled PSAT data covering deployments along the eastern coast of North America with the objective of obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of swordfish movement, migrations and behaviour. DFO Resource Management Branch, in conjunction with the Science sector, has initiated a comprehensive work plan to address the incidental catch in Canadian large pelagics fisheries, with a focus on six key species: bluefin tuna, porbeagle shark, shortfin mako shark, blue shark, leatherback and loggerhead turtles, as well as discarding of swordfish. The work plan was vetted through the ecosystem working group of ALPAC and consists of a number of projects with three main objectives: examining appropriate levels of observer coverage, managing discards for all targeted species, and controlling incidental mortality for non-targeted species. In 2009, there were approximately 134 Swordfish licences issued by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) that reported swordfish landings, with the overwhelming majority (99%) held in Nova Scotia in DFOâs Maritimes Region, as shown in Table 2. A breakdown of these licences by gear-type is presented in Table 3. Data indicate an increasing percentage of licences using harpoon gear to catch swordfish compared to longline gear, over 2005-2009. In 2009, the volume of swordfish landings in Atlantic Region was 1,300 metric tonnes (t), slightly down from 1,383t in 2008. These round weight landings represented about 1% of total pelagics and other finfish landings in Atlantic Region that year. The value of swordfish landings in 2009 was $7.7 million, down 12% from 2008 ($8.8 million). In 2009, swordfish accounted for 11% of the landed value of total pelagics and other finfish category, ranking fourth after herring (45%), mackerel (19%) and total tuna (12%). From 2004 to 2008, over 98% of swordfish (in terms of value) was landed in Nova Scotia. Swordfish are landed using three gear types in the Atlantic Region. In 2008-2009, about 80% of swordfish were landed by longline, followed by harpoon, and a very small amount by rod and reel, as seen in Table 6. Recent average price has decreased from $8.47/kg in 2006 to $5.94/kg in 2009. Table 7 shows the average price by gear type for 2008-2009. The United States (U.S.) which accounted for 99.95% of swordfish exports in 2009, is the major export market for swordfish from the Atlantic Region. After the U.S., France is a distant second export destination. The landed value of swordfish has been very close to its export value during 2004-2007, but the two have diverged during 2008 and 2009 (Figure 3). Over 2004-2009, swordfish landed value (based on round weight) has ranged from $10.1 million to $7.7 million, while swordfish export value (based on dressed weight) has ranged from $10.7 million to $12.8 million. Domestic imports of Swordfish in Canada decreased over 2008-2009 from 423,408 kg to 370,429 kg (13%) and declined, in value terms, from $2.98M to $2.75M (8%). The North West Atlantic Region harpoon swordfish has been certified as sustainable as of 18 June 2010Footnote 1, whereas the North Atlantic longline swordfish has certified as sustainable as of April 19, 2012. Table 8 shows that in 2009, there were 123 swordfish harvesters in the Atlantic Region, with swordfish representing 22% of the total value of all species they landed. Of this total number of harvesters, there were 88 (71%) who also caught lobster with landed values almost twice the value of swordfish landings that year. Very few fish harvesters rely on swordfish as their main source of fishing income. According to Table 9, only 18 harvesters (15%) have greater than 50% dependency on this species. In comparison, 61 (50%) rely on income from harvesting swordfish for less than 10% of their fishing revenue. Table 10 and Appendix 6 presents the income dependency profile of swordfish harvesters based on home port, in 2009. âHome Portâ means that ort identified by the fisher upon registering his vessel with DFO. While âhome portâ does not reflect residency, it normally refers to the port from which the fisher usually operates. It may be assumed that home port is often close to the residency of the fisher. The landed values relate to only those home ports indicated by swordfish harvesters in 2009. To meet data confidentiality requirements, an âXâ is placed in the table where necessary. Dependency analysis based on home ports shows the earnings profile of harvesters by home port, no matter where they landed a particular species. In addition, assuming that the home port is a realistic proxy for the area of residence of fish harvesters, Table 10 shows the areas that are more dependent on revenues from swordfish. Most of the revenues from swordfish go to fish harvesters in Statistical Districts 22 (from the Western Shore of the Northwest Arm to Black Point, Shad Bay) and 32 (from Barrington River to the Yarmouth County line), which account for 65% of total swordfish landed value. Swordfish harvesters whose home port is Mitchell Bay, East Port Hebert, and Abbottâs Harbour (100%), Port Maitland (73%), and Clam Point (51%), show the greatest dependency on swordfish. Table 11 presents income dependency information from the perspective of the port of landing. According to this data, the ranking of ports of landing based on their dependency on swordfish revenues is as follows: Osborne Harbour (32%), Sambro (20%), and Woods Harbour (16%). In particular, the ports of Sambro and Woods Harbour together account for 75% of swordfish landed value, and both show a relatively high dependency on swordfish, 20% and 16% respectively. Overall, Statistical Districts 22 and 32 together capture 85% of the landed value. Information is presented regarding the following three sub-species of tuna: Albacore, Bigeye, and Yellowfin. The majority of tuna licences for these tunas are concentrated in the Nova Scotia portion of the Maritimes Region (Table 12). In 2009, there were a total of 63 tuna licences, with 94% of these licences held in the Nova Scotia portion of the Maritimes Region. Quantities and Values â Tuna Species (Albacore, Bigeye, Yellowfin) Over the period, 2008-2009, the quantity of total tuna landings decreased by 48% and the tuna sub-species registered a decline as follows: Yellowfin 69%, Albacore 68%, and Bigeye 17%. The volume of Albacore tuna landings dropped from 33,544 kg to 10,738 kg between 2008 and 2009. At the same time, the value of landings declined by 85%, from $386,087 to $56,807, during the same period. Longline was the most common gear type for harvesting Albacore tuna, followed by rod and reel, and harpoon. Albacore tuna exports peaked in 2007 ($191,181) and fell by 96% to under $8,000 by 2009 (Figure 4). U.S. and Japan have been the main export destinations for Albacore tuna over this period. The Japanese market registered a substantial increase between 2006 ($8,553) and 2008 ($45,540) but there were no reported Albacore tuna exports to Japan in 2009. The U.S. was Canadaâs only export destination for the year 2009. Domestic imports of Albacore tuna in Canada increased over 2008-2009 from 1.67M kg to 2.56M kg (53%) and increased, in value terms, from $5.6M to $8.8M (59%). Bigeye tuna quantity of landings decreased from 133,806 kg in 2008 to 110,997 kg in 2009. The value of landings dropped by 17%, from $1.5 million to $1.27 million during 2008 and 2009. Table 16 shows that longline was the most common (96%) gear type for harvesting Bigeye tuna. Harpoon and rod and reel accounted for the remaining 4% of the value of landings. Bigeye tuna exports fell by 36%, from $1.7 million in 2004 to just over $1.0 million in 2009 (Figure 5). Over 2008-2009, the U.S. was the only export destination for Bigeye tuna. Japan has historically been another major export market, but dropped off in 2008. Domestic imports of Bigeye tuna in Canada increased over 2008-2009 from 0.54M kg. to 0.87M kg. (61%) and increased, in value terms, from $4.2M to $5.5M (32%). Yellowfin tuna landings dropped from 169,932 kg in 2008 to 53,430 kg in 2009. The value of landings also declined from $1,199,701 to $377,101 (69%). Table 17 shows that virtually all harvesting of Yellowfin tuna is accomplished using longline gear. The value of Yellowfin tuna exports from Atlantic Region peaked in 2006 at $2.97 million and then fell steadily; down by 74% to $0.7 million in 2009 (Figure 6). The U.S. has been the main export market for Yellowfin tuna from the Atlantic Region (58% in 2009). Ecuador has notably become the second largest export market since 2008, accounting for 37% of Yellowfin tuna exports from the Atlantic Region. Domestic imports of Yellowfin tuna in Canada decreased over 2008-2009 from 1.07M kg to 0.72M kg (32%) and declined, in value terms, from $9.8M to $6.8M (30%). There are limited Skipjack tuna landings in the Atlantic Region from 2006 to 2009. Only 10t were reported to ICCAT from the 2009 fishery. During the period 2006-2009, Skipjack tuna exports from Atlantic Region were evidently based on imported raw materials that are, in turn, exported after processing. Domestic imports of Skipjack tuna in Canada slightly decreased over 2008-2009 from 35.5M kg to 34.8M kg (2%) and declined, in value terms, from $145.8M to $142.5M (2%). Thailand accounted for 95% of the imports in 2009, compared to approximately 2% from the Philippines. The value of Skipjack tuna exports, over the period 2004-2009, reached a high of $1.02 million in 2005 but fell sharply the following year (2006) (Figure 7). Export values leveled off between 2007 and 2009, ranging from $0.48 million to $0.50 million. There have been no Skipjack tuna exports to the U.S since 2008. In 2009, the Caribbean Islands of Saint Vincent Grenadines, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Jamaica, and Netherlands Antilles combined, have accounted for 69% of Skipjack tuna exports from the Atlantic Region (2009). Table 18 reveals the breakdown of the 2009 landed values for various species whose licences are also held by tuna harvesters. The vast majority of tuna harvesters (41) also hold a swordfish licence, and approximately half (21) also hold a lobster licence. Overall, the main licences also held by tuna harvesters are swordfish and lobster. Table 18 reflects the catches associated with Fishersâ Identification Numbers (FINs). Since multiple licences can be held under one FIN, the total number of licences reported in Table 12 may not equal the total number of harvesters. Table 19 shows that most of the individual tuna harvesters (44) rely on the tuna fishery for less than 10% of their annual income. The information in Table 20 and Appendix 7 shows, for tuna harvesters by home port, how dependent these tuna harvestersâ income is on tuna. It also indicates how dependent those home portsâ revenues are on tuna. For instance, the harvesters of Statistical District 31 with home ports Shelburne have a 51% dependency on tuna for their income, but the port of Shelburne as a whole does not significantly (3%) depend on tuna for its revenues. Statistical Districts 22 and 32 together account for 56% of the tuna landed value. Sambro, Woods Harbour and West Head are the principal home ports for tuna fish harvesters within these districts. Table 21 shows, for each port of landing, how income-dependent on tuna are those harvesters who landed in these ports, and how significant is tuna as a source of revenue in each of these ports. For instance, the harvesters who landed tuna in Lower Wedgeport (Statistical District 33) depended on tuna for 79% of their income. Overall, this port of landing did not depend significantly on tuna landings for its revenues. Sambro and Woods Harbour are the main landing ports for tuna, capturing 82% of total landed value. Overall, the port dependency on tuna is low. Again, Sambro and Woods Harbour are the most dependent on tuna, although this dependency is still low at 3% and 5%, respectively. Several domestic and international obligations require the swordfish longline fishery to not only address issues related to the conservation and sustainable management of its supporting fishery resource, swordfish and other tunas, but also non-related pelagic species incidentally caught species especially those of concern here or elsewhere, and the environment in general. Specifically, ICCAT requirements, the International Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, by-catch guidelines and the IPOA on Capacity, Sharks, and Seabirds under the auspices of the United Nations FAO, the Oceans Act, and the Species at Risk Act are relevant to these fisheries and gear types, and especially to the swordfish longline fishery, which is less selective with regard to incidental catch. Currently there are two options available for management of small swordfish, both of which involve minimum fish size criteria established by ICCAT. Both options have the potential of requiring the release of small swordfish harvested in the catch, either as live releases or as dead discards. In the Canadian situation, a non-selective catch of undersized fish by harpoon is not considered to be an issue given that the harpoon harvest is almost exclusively mature fish. The longline fleets are the primary source of incidentally caught small fish. The option made available since 1996 includes a minimum fish size 119 cm LJFL with zero tolerance on small fish or a minimum size of 125 cm LJFL with a 15% tolerance for fish under that size. While the previous approach by the longline fleet had been to use the smaller size and no tolerance, given that they had been provided a discard allowance until 2004, with zero tolerance on landing small fish, this resulted in significant discards in some years that was counted against the fleetâs quota. In more recent years, the Canadian longline fleet has opted for using the 125 cm length with the tolerance reducing the need to discard small fish. Although all discards have been reduced and continue to be accounted for through estimates of release by licence holders, quantities of small north Atlantic swordfish continue to be discarded annually. Incidental by-catch and discarding of non-targeted species occur in many fisheries. Discarding of targeted species also occurs for a variety of regulatory reasons, e.g. undersized fish, licence restrictions, etc. There are no by-catch concerns related with the use of harpoon gear in the swordfish fishery and conditions of license for that fishery specify that the license holder/operator is authorized to direct for and retain swordfish only. There continues to be some concerns about by-catch and discard issues in Canadian large pelagic fisheries with a focus on the swordfish/other tuna longline fishery. The swordfish longline fishery target species are swordfish and bigeye, yellowfin and albacore tunas. Over the past decade, as by-catch concerns were identified in the swordfish/other tuna longline fleet, the fleet was pro-active in taking a number of mitigative steps to address this issue. First and foremost, the fleet practices live release, to the extent possible, of all sensitive species or other non-target species that are captured. In 2001 and 2002, the Nova Scotia Swordfishermenâs Association (NSSA) obtained funding through Environment Canadaâs Habitat Stewardship Fund to pay for increased observer coverage to determine the extent and possible means for mitigation of sea turtle by-catch by their fleet. In 2003, the NSSA developed a Code of Conduct for Responsible Sea Turtle Handling and Mitigative Measures, which some parts are now included in licence conditions. All licence holders must follow this Code of Conduct as a condition of their licence, which includes measures such as avoiding areas of high sea turtle capture rates and notifying all vessels operating in the area if high sea turtle capture rates are encountered; as well as gear hauling protocols to minimize harm to any turtles that may be captured, sea turtle handling guidelines and usage instructions for de-hooking gear. Over the course of 2003-2004, de-hooking and line-cutting kits were purchased by the NSSA to supply each active vessel in the fishery. In 2008, all licence holders in this fishery received training and certification in the use of this equipment through a workshop given by the US National Marine Fisheries Service. Training was also provided in 2011 both as a refresher and to licence holders needing to be trained. The Canadian Sea Turtle Network has agreed to take over training for all licence holders, crew and Fisheries Officers starting in 2013. A gear configuration with longer gangion lines allows captured animals such as sea turtles to get to the surface to breathe, which enables live release in nearly all cases. The majority of the fleet has voluntarily used circle hooks to increase the chances of survival for released species and in 2012 this measure was made mandatory through inclusion in licence conditions. By-catch includes several groups of other pelagic species such as sharks, marlins, tunas and other by-catch species. Approximately 16 of the upwards of 25 species typically caught are landed, reported and marketed, thus minimizing resource waste. As identified in Section 1.7.8 landings of three species of shark are limited by quota caps: porbeagle 50t; blue shark 250t; and shortfin mako 100t. Under the current bluefin tuna management plan, the swordfish longline fleet is provided an annual bluefin tuna quota of 18.76t in the western Atlantic and an ICCAT allocation of 15t in the central north Atlantic to address bluefin by-catches and eliminate discards. These allocations, along with the ability to receive transfers from other inshore bluefin tuna fleets, have resulted in discards of bluefin tuna by the pelagic longline fleet having been reduced in at-sea observer records. The offshore swordfish and other tuna licence holder also receive a 20t domestic allocation of bluefin tuna to support retention of bluefin by-catch by this licence holder. Finally, the research program identified in Section 2.1.5 examining the impacts of by-catch in the pelagic longline fishery with a view towards further mitigation of catches of sensitive species, as required, is currently on-going within DFO. The research program will also undertake studies to better understand the impacts of discards of sharks and other species that are incidentally harvested and released by the pelagic longline fleet. Canadaâs NPOA for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries notes that the impact of Canadaâs longline fisheries on global incidental catch of seabirds tends to be very low. This has been further confirmed by incidental by-catch analyses of observer data in 2000 and subsequent years. Nevertheless, measures have been and continue to be implemented to better understand the extent of the issue and if further mitigation measures are required to reduce seabird by-catch in Canadian longline fisheries. This NPOA provides an assessment of by-catch levels of seabirds within Canadaâs longline fisheries, identifies priorities for the NPOA, highlights Canadaâs current legislative framework and international commitments, reviews Canadaâs integrated fisheries management framework, and presents a series of actions for better identifying by-catch levels and further enhancing efforts to reduce the incidental capture of seabirds. A status update on the actions taken under the NPOA since the 2007 report is expected to be completed by the summer of 2012. Canadaâs NPOA for the Conservation and Management of Sharks identifies management measures pertinent to shark by-catch in the swordfish longline fishery. The 2007 NPOA on sharks notes that globally, the impact of Canadaâs fishing activities on shark populations tends to be low. Nevertheless, the NPOA clearly identifies that measures have been and continue to be implemented to improve the management of these species. This NPOA provides an overview of shark stocks in Canadian fisheries waters, identifies priorities for the NPOA, highlights Canadaâs current legislative framework and international commitments, and outlines current measures to monitor, assess and manage these populations and their related fisheries. Recommendations for possible enhancements to existing conservation and management practices are also presented. A status update on the actions taken with regard to sharks since the 2007 report is expected to be completed by the summer of 2012. The Species at Risk Act (SARA) came into force in 2003. The purposes of the Act are âto prevent wildlife species from being extirpated or becoming extinct, and to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that are extirpated, endangered or threatened as a result of human activity and to manage species of special concern to prevent them from becoming endangered or threatenedâ. In 2004, porbeagle sharks (Lamna nasus) were designated as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and the stock was considered for listing on Schedule 1 of SARA. Analysis from the 2005 Recovery Potential Assessment (RPA) for porbeagle sharks (available on the DFO website) indicates that the stock population could recover if human-induced mortality was kept below about 4% of vulnerable biomass (about 185 t per year). As DFO determined that the population could recover, current and future management of this species is to ensure that mortality is kept below this 4% level as required for recovery. As such, the government decided not to list porbeagle sharks as endangered under the Species at Risk Act. Current management measures for this stock limit harvests to no more than 185t per year. Landings in most recent years have only been about half of that level with by-catches by the pelagic longline fleet averaging approximately 50 tonnes per year. Given the low productivity of the porbeagle, it is expected to take several decades for this species to recover from its low abundance. COSEWIC has also recommended that great white sharks be listed as Endangered, that shortfin makos be listed as Threatened, and that blue and basking sharks be listed as Special Concern. Recovery Potential Assessments completed in 2006 are available for both shortfin mako and white sharks on the Fisheries and Oceans Canada website. The government has listed white shark under SARA and is currently considering whether or not some or all of the remaining species should also be listed. As noted in the RPA, since mako sharks are not part of a directed fishery in Canada and by-catch rates represent only a small portion of the global population, it is expected that current exploitation rates by Canadian fishing fleets are not having a significant negative impact on the sustainability of this species. The RPA for shortfin mako noted that it is unlikely that a reduction in by-catch of shortfin makos by the Canadian pelagic longline fishery would have any detectable or biologically significant influence on the population; however, it would be prudent not to exceed 100t annually. In line with recommendations from the RPA, the swordfish longline fleet has been releasing all live caught makos to reduce mortality. The RPA for white sharks notes that the abundance in Canada would in general follow the trajectory of the North Atlantic population, a component of which has declined in recent decades in U.S. waters. Therefore, the recovery potential in Canadian waters will be dependent on the overall recovery in U.S. and other North Atlantic waters. The RPA concludes that given the very poor status of the population, any level of harm would jeopardize its survival or recovery. Since white sharks are so rare in Canadian waters and since their capture would be as incidental by-catch, the only viable management option to enhance the recovery of white sharks in the Atlantic Ocean is the live release of captures. However there has been no documented incidental catch of white sharks in this fishery over the past decade. In 2012 white shark was listed under the Species at Risk Act and the fishery is now prohibited to retain any white shark. The most recent assessment by ICCAT noted that for both North and South Atlantic blue shark stocks, although the results are highly uncertain, biomass is believed to be above the biomass that would support Maximum Sustainable Yield and that the current harvest levels are sustainable. However, according to recent domestic research, the catch mortality for blue sharks within Canadian Atlantic fisheries waters may have been greatly underestimated in the past. As blue sharks are of low commercial value, they are regularly discarded as by-catch within the commercial pelagic fishery. Historically, such discards of by-catch have not been regularly recorded. While blue shark are likely the most commonly caught large shark in Canadian fisheries waters actual landings are very low annually (less than 1 tonne) due to lack of markets/value. While by-catch rates for blue sharks may be higher than those for other shark species, research suggests that they have a higher survival rate on returning to the water as long as appropriate handling techniques are used. Over the past decade, the blue shark population in Canadian fisheries waters has been in decline while mortality has been increasing. Catch rates for commercial longline fisheries and recreational tournaments have fallen and the median size of blue sharks caught has decreased. This warrants ongoing monitoring of the species. It is estimated that catch mortality within the total North Atlantic ranges between 26,000 and 32,000 tonnes for blue shark. These are considered to be low estimates, of which the Canadian portion is very small. Tagging studies show that blue sharks are extremely migratory and do not establish long-term residency in Canadian fisheries waters. Further research on the blue shark population and fishery within Canadian fisheries waters is warranted and in particular the impact of reported and unreported catches requires further assessment. Since 1995, fishery management plans have placed non-restrictive catch guidelines of 250 tonnes on blue sharks within the directed fishery (i.e., for longline, handline, and rod-and-reel gear). In April 2010, COSEWIC assessed the status of loggerhead sea turtles as Endangered and in response the government of Canada is considering listing it under the SARA. The status of the loggerhead sea turtle is a species of conservation concern however, a decision on listing under SARA may take several years. In the interim period DFO actively investigated strategies and tactics to reduce human impacts to loggerheads in the waters of Atlantic Canada. The only documented source of human-induced harm or mortality in Canadian waters is fishery by-catch in the Canadian swordfish longline fishery that targets swordfish and tuna species (Harris et al. 2010). Harris, L.E., W.E. Gross, R.K. Smedbol, and L.H. Bondt. 2010. Loggerhead Sea Turtles (Caretta caretta) in Atlantic Canada: Biology, Status, Recovery Potential, and Measures for Mitigation. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc. 2010/089: viii + 36 p. The loggerhead sea turtle RPA meeting in February 2010 was unable to assess the impact of proposed mitigation strategies on population abundance and distribution in Canadian waters, however the range and scope of the threats overall would suggest that the Canadian fleet is not the primary threat to the recovery of the species. Following the RPA, the Maritimes Region developed the âAtlantic Canadian Loggerhead Turtle Conservation Action Planâ. This plan has several strategies which will apply to the pelagic longline fleet including: With the assistance of the fleet tagging of 37 loggerhead turtles occurred in the 2012 and information from these PSAT tags will be compiled in 2013. The Leatherback turtle was listed as endangered under SARA in June 2003. Fisheries and Oceans Canada led the development of a recovery strategy for Atlantic Leatherback turtles. Success in the recovery of this species will require the commitment and cooperation of many different constituencies that will be involved in implementing the directions set out in this strategy which specifies measures that can be taken under Canadian jurisdiction to promote the recovery of the Atlantic leatherback turtle. The recovery goal is to âachieve the long-term viability of the leatherback turtle populations frequenting Atlantic Canadian watersâ and will not be achieved by Fisheries and Oceans Canada or any other jurisdiction alone. The strategy to assist with the rebuilding of Leatherback turtles in Atlantic Canada is outlined in the Leatherback Turtle Recovery Strategy for the stock that has been prepared as a requirement under the Species at Risk Act. The leatherback turtle has also been listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). Canada signed this treaty, as have many of the countries that host nesting or migratory populations of leatherbacks. CITES attempts to ensure that trade in endangered species do not threaten the existence of those species. Time/Area closures: In addition to the legislated closure of Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area (MPA), there are several closed areas that restrict swordfish and other tuna harvest in order to reduce potential gear conflicts with other fisheries, to protect swordfish broodstock, and/or to minimize the by-catch of bluefin tuna. Swordfish licence holders are restricted from activity within Fishing Zones of Canada 1 (Gulf of St. Lawrence) and 2 (Bay of Fundy). Other existing closures that are in place in the swordfish fishery for oceanic considerations include: Bluefin Exclusion Zone closed to longline gear Aug. 1 - Dec. 31; the Swordfish Broodstock Closure to harpoon gear Sept. 1 - Dec. 31; and a closure of the Hell Hole to longline gear annually from July 1 - November 30. The Government of Canada is working with the provinces and territories to conserve Canada's marine ecosystems through the development of a National Network of Marine Protected Areas. Marine protected areas are effective in protecting plants, animals and habitats as well as enhancing biodiversity and improving the health and sustainable use of our oceans, Great Lakes and coastlines, while also contributing to Canadian coastal communities and industries. Canada has almost 800 marine protected areas, which together protect about one percent of the marine environment. Existing and proposed marine protected areas provide the foundation for building the national network of marine protected areas, which will be composed of a number of bioregional networks of marine protected areas. Fisheries and Oceans Canada will continue to work with marine resource users, including swordfish and other tunas fishing fleets, to establish a National Framework. The National Framework is an important step towards meeting Canada's domestic and international commitments to establish a national network of marine protected areas. The impacts of pelagic longline gear are reviewed in the DFO CSAS publication: âDFO. 2010. Potential impacts of fishing gears (excluding mobile bottom-contacting gears) on marine habitats and communities. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Sci. Advis. Rep. 2010/003â Leatherback and loggerhead turtles are incidentally captured in nets and entangled in fishing lines in pelagic and coastal foraging areas and in migratory corridors. Leatherbacks are the most vulnerable of all Atlantic sea turtles to entanglement in fishing gear such as pelagic longlines, fixed pot gear and gillnets, buoy anchor lines, and other ropes and cables. Interactions between fishing activities and Northern Bottlenose Whales are not well understood. Observations have shown a small number of northern bottlenose whales entangled in, or interacting with, fishing gear. Several entanglements in Atlantic Canada have been recorded in longline gear, involving both bottom and pelagic fisheries. One of the longline entanglements involved pelagic gear on the Grand Banks and the whale was released alive. It is unknown if Northern Bottlenose Whales on the Grand Banks are from the endangered Scotian Shelf population or the separate Davis Strait population. Another line-gear entanglement involved a Northern Bottlenose Whale with its beak wrapped in monofilament in the Gully pre-MPA designation. Evidence from this later incident is not conclusively pelagic longline gear. Other cetacean species are at risk of gear entanglement given the overlap in space and time between the swordfish longline fishery and annual whale migrations along the Scotian Shelf. Lost gear from the Scotian Shelf swordfish longline fishery represents a potential entanglement threat to sea turtles, whales, and bottom-dwelling species (e.g., coral and/or sponge communities). However, all licence holders have radio transmitters on their longline gear which allows for recovery of most lost gear. Within the swordfish fishery conducted in the North Atlantic Canadian waters and on the adjacent high seas, international and national agencies have defined roles, responsibilities and authority for fisheries management. At an international level, fishing for swordfish, both on the high seas and in zones of national jurisdiction, is governed by the International Convention on the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna of 1966. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) was established under the Convention and is tasked with the coordination of scientific research and making recommendations designed to maintain populations of tuna at levels which will permit maximum sustainable yield (MSY). To obtain this objective, the Commission has adopted minimum permissible size (weight) limits for swordfish and tuna caught and retained, overall catch limits for various species, gear regulations and schemes for international and port inspection. Canada provides information based on ICCAT Tasks 1 and 2 which includes catch-at-size information on catch and discards. Licence conditions require the release of all live marlin species caught and recent landings (2009 - 0.6t) are well below the ICCAT reference years of 1996 and 1999 when Canada reported landings of 8t and 5t respectively. In addition, ICCAT identified a concern on by-catch of shortfin mako. Catches of shortfin mako have been decreasing in recent years to 43t in 2009. Therefore domestic management measures for the swordfish fishery fully meet the minimum requirements as established by ICCAT and in many cases are significantly stricter than those established in the ICCAT Recommendations for the North Atlantic Swordfish Fishery. There are five overarching objectives that guide fisheries management planning for the Atlantic swordfish and other tuna fisheries. They are guided by the principle that the fishery is a common property resource to be managed for the benefit of all Canadians, consistent with conservation objectives, the constitutional protection afforded Aboriginal and treaty rights, and the relative contributions that various uses of the resource make to Canadian society, including socio-economic benefits to communities. The conservation objectives are those from DFOâs framework for an ecosystem approach to management (EAM framework). They require consideration of the impact of the fishery not only on the target species but also on non target species and habitat. The social, cultural and economic objectives reflect the Aboriginal right to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes. They also recognize the economic contribution that the fishing industry makes to Canadian businesses and many coastal communities. Ultimately, the economic viability of fisheries depends on the industry itself. However, the Department is committed to managing the fisheries in a manner that helps its members be economically successful while using the oceanâs resources in an environmentally sustainable manner. This section of the IFMP presents the strategies and tactics being used in this fishery to achieve the general objectives listed in Section 5. For a general description of strategies and tactics in the context of the EAM framework, see Appendix 1. While those objectives may be considered to be general statements, they are translated into practical terms through the definition of strategies. The strategies outlined in this IFMP constitute what is being done to manage pressures imposed by fishing activities in order to control their impact on valued fish population and ecosystem attributes. Strategies are not included where the fisheries are not considered to have a significant impact. Tactical management measures are âhowâ the strategies will be implemented to manage the pressures imposed by fishery activities. The principal tactical management measures that will be applied in this fishery to implement the key strategies identified above are described here. (Note that tactics may regulate more than one pressure. They are listed here under the strategies that they are most strongly associated with.) Under the international stewardship of ICCAT, this fishery uses management methods that adhere to ICCAT objectives to keep fishing mortality moderate. ICCAT has identified rebuilding objectives, particularly for swordfish and bigeye Tuna, based on established reference limits within a precautionary approach. This approach is based primarily on maintaining stocks at a level to support the maximum sustainable yield. Canada adheres to its assigned quota adjusted for quota transfers from other countries and application of fleet quota overages or underages from the previous year. Development of and adherence to the TAC ensures that consideration is given to the impact of discards on the reproductive potential of the target species. By-catch quota of porbeagle shark and catch limits on shortfin mako and blue shark in the longline fishery are based on the best available current information for those species. As further information becomes available these catch limits will be reviewed to ensure fishing mortality is kept moderate. Reproductive potential is supported through the use of temporal and geographical closures in order to reduce interactions with spawning stock biomass. These closures identify the importance of nearer shore areas in late summer/fall. Without specific TAC levels for many pelagic species, monitoring of the landings identifies the impact on the species and reduces waste of the resource. A joint project between industry and the department is implementing a Work plan to Address Incidental Catch in Canadian Large Pelagic Fisheries. This is a comprehensive work plan for monitoring fishing activity, measuring the discard mortality and establishing suitable references to indicate when that mortality is unacceptable. The focus of this plan is directed toward six key species; bluefin tuna, porbeagle shark, shortfin mako, blue shark, leatherback turtle and loggerhead sea turtle as well as the discarding of swordfish. This work plan includes several broad level projects. The nature of this fishery is such that unintended incidental mortality is significantly reduced through fishing practices that promote avoidance or release of by-catch species. This strategy is particularly important for protecting species listed as threatened or endangered under SARA. Licence conditions require the release of all incidentally- caught SARA species and licence holders and vessel operators have received training in the safe handling and release of turtles. Northern bottlenose whales are further protected by the Gully Marine Protected Area Zone 1, which has been identified as critical habitat for the Scotian Shelf population. Fishing practices also supporting the avoidance of by-catch species include the NSSA Code of Conduct which promotes moving away from areas of incidental catch and informing other licence holders of these areas. The use of 16/0 circle hooks reduces the by-catch of small species and compared to J hooks reduces harm to discards. Industry compliance with the Fisheries and Oceans Atlantic Canadian Loggerhead Turtle Conservation Action Plan and the NSSA Code of Conduct (including the use of de-hooking equipment) reduces impact on the most common SARA species with which this fishery interacts. Implementation of the Workplan to Address Incidental Catch in Canadian Large Pelagic Fisheries will have similar support for biodiversity objectives as with productivity objectives. Habitat impacts for pelagic fisheries are not as obvious compared with bottom contact fisheries and therefore are more difficult to assess. Recovery and prevention of lost longline gear will reduce ghost fishing and potential interactions with marine species (e.g. entanglement with whales or turtles). Lost gear has the potential to continue fishing as dead catch would become bait for other animals. The use of radio transmitters on the gear by industry ensures that lost gear is kept to a minimum. Closures such as the Gully (Zone 1) have served to protect critical habitat during their migration. The Northern Bottlenose Whale Recovery Strategy identifies Zone 1 of the Gully Marine Protected Area and areas with water depths greater than 500 meters in Haldimand Canyon and Shortland Canyon as critical habitat for the Scotian Shelf population. Under s. 2 of the Species at Risk Act, critical habitat is ââ¦ habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the speciesâ critical habitat in the recovery strategy or in an action plan for the species.â Once critical habitat is identified in a Recovery Strategy or an Action Plan, it must be protected within 180 days. Critical Habitat protection applies only to the habitat itself, including the features, functions and attributes of the habitat that make it necessary for the survival and recovery of the species. Regular fishing activity by a relatively small group of fishing interests does overlap with known Northern Bottlenose Whale critical habitat. The primary fisheries are with groundfish longline gear directing for halibut, and pelagic longline gear directing for swordfish. The swordfish longline fishery crosses the mouths of several canyons along the edge and slope of the Scotian Shelf, but is excluded from deepwater areas (Zone 1) of the Gully MPA. Given that no known or active fisheries were thought likely to destroy critical habitat for the Northern Bottlenose Whale, the Recovery Strategy did not list fishing activities as âactivities likely to destroy critical habitat.â Direct interactions between species at risk and activities including fisheries are typically dealt with under the general prohibition of SARA (s. 32), which prohibits the harm, harassment, capture, kill or take of species at risk, either purposefully or incidentally. Section 32 applies as soon as the species is listed under SARA, and is independent of the areas identified and protected as critical habitat. The boundaries of Critical Habitat for a given species have no bearing on where and when s. 32 of SARA applies. SARA offers two options for ensuring the protection of critical habitat: the development of a Protection Statement (which uses other Acts of Parliament to prevent the destruction of critical habitat), or the creation of a Protection Order (putting into force s. 58 of SARA, which prohibits the destruction of critical habitat). In 2010, a Protection Statement was posted for the Northern Bottlenose Whale critical habitat located in Shortland and Haldimand canyons. Other Acts of Parliament required to protect the identified critical habitat from fishing activities were not listed, as these activities were not identified as âactivities likely to destroy critical habitatâ in the Recovery Strategy. As a result of a 2010 Federal court decision on killer whale critical habitat, how critical habitat is protected in the future under the Species at Risk Act will change. The 2010 Protection Statement for Northern Bottlenose Whales will be replaced in 2011/2012 by a Protection Order (s. 58(4)), which will put into force the SARA s. 58 prohibition against the destruction of critical habitat. In 1990, the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in R. v. Sparrow. In this landmark decision, the Court provided meaning and context to the Constitution Act, 1982, section 35(1) and held that, after conservation and other âvalid legislative objectivesâ, Aboriginal rights to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes have priority over all other uses of the fishery. Aboriginal communal food, social and ceremonial fishing is a cultural and sustenance activity. The resources fished through an FSC licence are used communally to provide food for its members, and support the traditional social and ceremonial activities of the First Nations community or Aboriginal group. There are no Food Social and Ceremonial (FSC) licences in this fishery. With the introduction of the longline fleet rationalization, an ITQ system and fleet exemption status, operating costs can be reduced. Supply and demand requirements, as well as operating costs can be controlled through the ITQ management system and quota carry-over provisions. MSC certification completed in the harpoon fishery and currently underway in the longline fishery should allow the industry to maintain access as markets demand more sustainable fishing practices and may result in increased prices. Canada and other countries receive an allocation of the overall TAC from ICCAT. The TAC has been set at 13,700t for 2012. It should be noted that country allocations (Table 23) have exceeded the TAC since 2007. However, a number of countries have not landed their full allocation and therefore total catches have not exceeded the TAC. Areas of operations include inside and outside of the Canadian Exclusive Economic Zone. The access to outside area is limited to a single offshore licence which is provided a 5t swordfish allocation. The remaining quota, along with transfers from other countries, is allocated at the beginning of the year 90% going to the pelagic longline fleet and 10% going to the harpoon fleet (up to a maximum of 150t). The harpoon fleet allocation is further divided with the main portion for the Group A licence holders and a small allocation (9t in 2011) to the Group B licence holders based on usage in the previous years. Uncaught quota for both the longline and harpoon fleets may be carrier over to the next year up to a maximum of 25% of their initial shares as per ICCAT rules. However in an ICCAT swordfish assessment year (usually very 3 years and next expected in 2013) no roll-over of harpoon quota is allowed and any uncaught harpoon quota as of September 30th will be transferred to the longline fleet. The option of Harvest Benefit Combining was introduced in 2013 for the Harpoon A fleet to reduce over-capacity. Under this program licence holders will be able to combine their licence landing history resulting in the elimination of one licence and increased access for the remaining licence. Note: The Minister can, for reasons of conservation or for any other valid reasons, modify access, allocations and sharing arrangements as outlined in this IFMP in accordance with the powers granted pursuant to the Fisheries Act. Within the country allocations:
            (1) The United States may harvest up to 200 t of its annual catch limit within the area between 5 degrees North latitude and 5 degrees South latitude. (2) For each year of this catch quota allocation, the United States will transfer 25 t to Canada. Senegal has transferred 100t and will continue this practice in 2013. These transfers do not change the relevant shares of Parties as reflected in the above allocation. (3) The European Union shall be allowed to count up to 200t of its swordfish catch taken from the South Atlantic management area against its uncaught North Atlantic swordfish quota. Limitations covering other tunas and pelagic by-catch are as follows. Albacore Bigeye Yellowfin Shark by-catch There are two main bodies that foster shared stewardship within the swordfish fishery. The Atlantic Large Pelagics Advisory Committee (ALPAC) is the main body for both industry and the department to work collaboratively on the management of large pelagic species in Atlantic Canada. Aside from the representation of most sectors of DFO, the ALPAC group is made up of industry stakeholders that include: fish harvesters; processors; representatives from each of the Atlantic Provinces and Quebec; as well as other environmental non-government organizations. The ALPAC normally meets at least twice annually. In the spring of each year ALPAC reviews the fishery from the previous year and the members discuss any issues/concerns and recommendations for the domestic management of the fishery. In the fall and in advance of the annual ICCAT meeting, the Department meets with ALPAC members to discuss and adopt Canadian positions at ICCAT. Fleet representatives for both the swordfish pelagic longline and harpoon fleets are actively engaged in the ALPAC process. There is also a smaller ALPAC Advisors group that meets several times per year in order to provide strategic input into the Canadian positions and recommendations for the annual meetings of ICCAT. This sub-group is made up of a select number of large pelagic fleet representatives including representatives from both the swordfish pelagic longline and harpoon fleets. An âEcosystem Working Groupâ was initiated in the spring of 2010. The Working Group is to provide advice to ALPAC and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) with respect to the implementation of an Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM) in the various large pelagic fisheries in Atlantic Canada. Both of the swordfish fleets, pelagic longline and harpoon, are represented on the working group. As well, since the Scotia Fundy sector of the Maritimes Region houses most of the licence holders in both the harpoon and longline sectors, the Scotia Fundy Large Pelagics Advisory Committee (SFLPAC) is the second tier government-industry consultative group that meets at least once per year to discuss fisheries issues in greater detail (that may be difficult in the larger ALPAC forum). The SFLPAC provides input and advice to Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) on the conservation, protection and utilization of the Canadian east coast fisheries resources of tunas, swordfish and shark, and on the management of the fisheries for these large pelagics resources. This Committee serves as the pre-eminent consultative forum for Scotia-Fundy based large pelagics fishing industry and government. The Committee will provide recommendations and advice on Maritimes (Scotia-Fundy) regional policy issues related to these fisheries. Consequently, the Committee can review recommendations made by sub-committees to determine what management measures could be included in regional fishing plans. Fishermenâs representatives from all swordfish fleets participate in the SFLPAC process. In collaboration with swordfish licence holders, Departmental scientists deployed 18 satellite tags (PSATs) on swordfish from the waters off southern Newfoundland in 2009. In 2010 an additional 7 swordfish were tagged in this area. This tagging will provide important information on swordfish migration into and out of Canadian waters as well as information on swordfish spawning. Blue sharks (listed as a Special Concern in Canada by COSEWIC) are the main by-catch species in the Atlantic Canada large pelagic longline fisheries. The pelagic longline fleets will continue to implement mitigation measures to address blue shark by-catch. As discussed in section 6.1 of this document a joint project between industry and the department is implementing a Work plan to Address Incidental Catch in Canadian Large Pelagic Fisheries. This is an ongoing comprehensive work plan for monitoring fishing activity and evaluating discards. Leatherback turtles were assessed as endangered under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). Members of the Canadian Swordfish Pelagic Longline Fisheries have voluntarily undertaken measures to ensure minimal harm to leatherback turtles which are unintentionally caught by longline gear. These responsible practices include: The management of Canadian fisheries requires an integrated approach to monitoring, control and surveillance that involves the deployment of fishery officers to air, sea and land patrols; observer coverage on fishing vessels; dockside monitoring program (DMP); and remote electronic monitoring (VMS). Conservation and Protection activities are designed to ensure compliance with the legislation, policies and fishing plans relating to the conservation and sustainable use of the resource. The C&P National Compliance Framework describes a three pillar approach to the sustainability of this and other fisheries. The pillars are respectively, Education/Shared Stewardship: Monitoring, Control and Surveillance; and Major Case Management. The full framework is available upon request. Compliance in the Swordfish fishery is achieved through the application of the Fisheries Act, the Fishery (General) Regulations, the Atlantic Fishery Regulations and the Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences Regulations by Fishery Officers. The following offers a general description of compliance activities carried out by C&P in the Swordfish Fishery. Shared stewardship and education are achieved in the Swordfish Fishery through a renewed emphasis on the importance of C&P communication with the community at large including: Almost all fishing for swordfish with longline gears takes place concurrently with activity for bigeye, yellowfin and albacore tunas and often with bluefin as well. C&P typically expends about 1% of its annual enforcement effort on large pelagics of which roughly half is dedicated to swordfish (in consideration of overlaps between tuna and swordfish). Given the relatively small number of active harvesters engaged in swordfish fisheries in comparison to activities such as lobster and groundfish, this level of attention to swordfish is probably commensurate. Nevertheless, C&P considers swordfish a priority species that has an international profile and will seek ways to refine its strategies or possibly increase the time spent in this fishery. A summary of officer time, patrol vessel days, aircraft hours, violations, observer coverage and penalties appears in the tables at the end of Section 9. Compliance issues remain relatively constant with minor issues continuing to dominate annually. Enforcement allocation of resources to this fishery increased in 2010 and has been relatively stable since that time. The following review is based on all violations recorded by Fishery Officers from 2005 to November 2012, information from observer reports and data from other sources such as DFOâs Fishery Officer time tracking system as well as catch and effort data. Issues associated with incidental catches of tuna and shark species are included. This review identified a total of 98 violations during the review period. Although this number may seem large, roughly half the cases concerned issues with little conservation impact such as personal registrations or hail time (a common problem across a broad spectrum of fisheries). A limited number of these cases (Â±10) can be considered serious and mostly focused on closed areas or attempts to misreport a range of species including bluefin tuna under the guise of a swordfish longline fishery. A list of violations according to compliance issue appears in the appendix. Whereas the swordfish fishery is little different from other adjacent activities (e.g.: groundfish, scallops) in that there is always room for improved compliance, it is also fair to state DFO requires harvesters to maintain a high standard in terms of the rules that govern this fishery. In its enforcement, C&P has on occasion found evidence of illegal practices and will target its effort to address these issues. Of the cases reviewed, 22 resulted in charges and 14 of these ended with a conviction and fine. In terms of assessing deterrent value, the level of enforcement and number of actions is probably insufficient but it is safe to assume the trend in other fisheries also applies to swordfish. Somewhat higher fines in other fisheries such as lobster are likely a consideration for those who would engage in harmful practices for swordfish. However, the lack of an effective licence sanction regime (licence suspension) or absence of ticketing for low end offences also take away from C&Pâs effort to establish an effective balance. For swordfish, Canadaâs compliance management must meet an international standard and reflect conservation measures established by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). While ensuring adequate attention to swordfish is a challenge in view of the compliance risks C&P must address elsewhere, it appears C&P exceeds international norms in its enforcement program for this fishery. C&P Detachment Supervisors prepare a work plan each year in which they allocate human, material and fiscal resources, weigh the compliance risks in each fishery and establish priorities. Table 24 is a summary of that process. C&P cannot be effective without the commitment on the part of the fishing industry to conservation of this valuable resource. Illegal Use of Gear  Closed Area and Time Issues Catch and Reporting Issues Management of the swordfish fishery relies first and foremost on the best available science advice. Canadian scientists are leading international efforts to learn more about swordfish migration and biology. They are supported in those efforts by Canadian swordfish harvesters, who understand the importance of sustainability for the future of the fisheries. All fishing activities are monitored through a number of management measures all requiring rigorous data collection. Mandatory reporting requirements for all licence holders include the completion of Commercial and Species at Risk DFO-approved logbooks. Logbooks provide information on the landings, fishing activity (i.e. position, depth, and gear) and discards. Scientists rely primarily on data derived from the commercial fishery. Canada, as a member of ICCAT, is obligated under ICCAT Tasks 1 and 2 to provide catch, catch-at-size, and effort information on catch and discards annually to ICCAT. CPUE information is calculated and submitted for stock assessments every 2 to 4 years. As a member of ICCAT Canada provides fishery statistics which are coordinated for research and stock assessments, and used to develop scientific-based management advice to mitigate ecosystem impacts of the fishery. The management objective of ICCAT is Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Hail in and Hail out requirements identify vessel activity and provide for scheduling of dockside monitoring and enforcement personnel. Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) requirements for longline gear allow for the monitoring of compliance with closed areas which protect swordfish broodstock, to prevent by-catch of bluefin tuna, and to protect sensitive areas like the Gully Marine Protected Area on the Scotian Shelf. Mandatory at-sea observer coverage requirements (10%) and taking biologists aboard on the longline vessels identify catch composition, and encounters with all by-catch species, including SARA-listed species. Industry provides funding for these independent at-sea observers to monitor the fishery. Science uses discard information recorded by observers to determine estimates of discards, dead or alive within and across fisheries. The at-sea monitoring assists in the monitoring of proper handling and release of identified Species at Risk, including leatherback turtles, and developing protocols to improve disentanglement and de-hooking to enhance post-capture survival. In addition at-sea observers assist in the monitoring the extent of seabird interaction and to ensure that further mitigation measures are not required in the Canadian longline fisheries. In 2012 the longline fleet was required to hail out using the âJust Talkâ system which immediately identified whether an at-sea observer would be required. This change improved the coverage distribution on all vessel sizes. Biweekly reviews were conducted of the geographical distribution of the at-sea observer coverage in comparison to the distribution of the entire fleet. Observer coverage was then shifted as required to ensure that all areas were adequately covered. In addition, if portions of the fleet shifted effort to new fishing areas the level of observer coverage in those areas would be in addition to the general 5% level of coverage. Dockside Monitoring provides landing information including weight and catch at size. The Atlantic longline fleets have been very proactive in introducing measures to protect the productivity of these fisheries as well as the potential impacts on the biodiversity of the ecosystem. The additional enhancements noted below will be evaluated and where viable implemented in order to improve the potential of meeting our objectives under an ecosystem approach to management. Productivity objectives will be enhanced with an increased use of the Precautionary Approach as Fisheries and Oceans Canada has officially endorsed implementation of the Precautionary Approach. ICCAT work to develop Limit Reference Points for Swordfish is scheduled began in March 2011. Plans will be developed to monitor and evaluate the amount of lost gear in this fishery. With the use of radio transmitters by the fleet the amount of lost gear is low but if required additional procedures will be developed to minimize lost gear and encourage gear recovery to increase habitat protection through the reduction of disturbed habitat. Biodiversity impacts are primarily associated with the interactions with by-catch species. The potential impact is particularly important with SARA species such as turtles. With the ongoing replacement of captains and crew the fleet needs to ensure that training in the use of de-hooking gear for turtles is continued and expanded. Previously certification in the use of this gear was conducted by US interests. The Canadian Sea Turtle Network has agreed to conduct training for all licence holders, crew and Fisheries Officers as part of a National certification processes that will reduce delays in the introduction of training. Data on the effect of fishing activities on SARA-listed species is often limited, and observer data and SARA logbooks will be monitored over time to estimate the contribution that the fishery makes to mortality of these species. This information will be used to evaluate potential research programs to further reduce impacts of by-catch through the promotion of avoidance of by-catch species. Useful tactics may include reduced soak times or the identification of temporal or geographical areas of high by-catch. DFO has developed a work plan to address incidental by-catch and discarding of non-target and target species in the Canadian large pelagic longline fishery. Continued partnership is encouraged for the improvement and implementation of this plan. Additional research programs such as tagging using PSAT may increase the knowledge on the biology of the animals which could further improve the management measures in these fisheries.

This appendix summarizes the framework adopted by DFO Maritimes Region for implementing an Ecosystem Approach to Management (EAM) in all activities for which the department has management responsibility. It also discusses application of the framework more specifically to fisheries management. Introduction to EAM An ecosystem approach to managing human activity requires consideration of an activityâs impact on all components of the ecosystem â including its structure, function and overall quality â and not just on the resource being used. It also means accounting for the cumulative effects of multiple uses, and accounting for how environmental forces, such as climate change, might be affecting how we should manage. Fully implementing EAM will be a large undertaking. Progress will happen in a step-by-step, evolutionary way. In the short-term, the Department will work on implementing EAM in the context of discrete activities, such as fishing. In the long-term, a diversity of ocean users and regulators will need to come together to draw up plans for the integrated management of all ocean activities. First attention will be given to impacts of the highest importance and offering the greatest scope for improvement. EAM in the Context of Fisheries Management Consensus is growing within Canada and internationally that the sustainability of fish stocks and fisheries requires an ecosystem approach to management. Traditionally, fisheries management has focused on regulating the impact of fishing on the targeted species. Under an ecosystem approach, managers consider impacts not only on the target species but also on non-target species and habitat. Some of these impacts will be direct, such as impacts on the populations of non target species that suffer mortality incidentally because of interactions with fishing gear. Other impacts may be indirect, such as the effects of mortality on predator-prey relationships. IFMPs will document the main impacts on the ecosystem from fishing activities and outline how these pressures will be managed. Main Elements of the Framework EAM is a management planning framework. Management planning requires the specification of objectives (what you want to achieve), of strategies (what you will do to manage human induced pressures so that you can achieve your objectives), and tactics (how you will implement your strategies). These elements are presented in the table overleaf. They are the foundation of the Regionâs EAM framework and have been developed to cover the full range of potential impacts on the ecosystem resulting from the various activities managed by the Department. (Not all strategies will be relevant to all activities.) Note: Elements associated with culture, sustenance and prosperity are provisional and at present are being applied only in fisheries management Objectives Under EAM, management planning within the Region will be guided by three ecosystem objectives: It is impractical to pursue conservation in isolation from the economic, social and cultural aspirations of users, and these must be recognized in any plan if it is to be successful. The Region intends to develop a set of economic, social and cultural objectives in the near future that will be common to all activities managed by the Department. In the meantime, Resource Management has developed the following, provisional objectives for application in fisheries management: Attributes Attributes are traits of the ecosystem that we value. They are the means by which the broadly stated objectives are given specificity. We might be interested in the condition of many ecosystem attributes. Those listed in the first column of Table 1A are ones that respond to human induced pressures. Examples of attributes of fish populations are yield, breeding behavior, biomass and genetic structure. Examples of ecosystem attributes are population richness, spatial occupancy and trophic structure. There are initiatives also by DFO to identify ecologically or biologically sensitive areas (EBSAs), ecologically or biologically sensitive species (EBSSs), Depleted Species and Degraded Areas. These too can be viewed as attributes of an ecosystem. Strategies and References As stated, objectives are very general statements that are translated into practical terms through the definition of strategies. Strategies state âwhatâ will be done to manage pressures from human activities. Common pressures from fishing activities are fishing mortality, incidental mortality, and disturbance of bottom habitat. The strategies aim to control the impact of these pressures on the valued ecosystem attributes. Strategies define how the pressures imposed by human activities will be managed. For example, what level of fishing mortality is viewed as acceptable? How much bottom habitat disturbance is too much? This is done by using references that define pressure levels that cause unacceptable or undesirable impacts on the attributes. The basis for determining references will vary depending on the state of knowledge. Some may be chosen fairly arbitrarily when knowledge is weak, perhaps based on historical trends. When more is known, their determination may involve evaluation of alternative population/ecosystem dynamics models, ranging from 'single species' to 'full ecosystem' models. There are many gaps in scientific knowledge of ecosystem structure and function, and, no matter how references are determined, they will need revision as the human and environmental factors affecting ecosystems become better understood. Tactics Tactics are sometimes referred to as tactical management measures. They are âhowâ the strategies will be implemented to manage the pressures imposed by fishery activities. Examples of common tactics in fisheries management are total allowable catches, individual or community quotas, seasonal closures, gear restrictions, minimum fish sizes and dockside monitoring.  Monitoring and Evaluation Monitoring and evaluation are necessary for ensuring management plans are working as intended. Monitoring involves collecting data that will provide information on how well or badly the various features of the plan are performing. Evaluation involves determining whether strategies are being implemented adequately and whether they are doing their job in meeting the plan objectives. Evaluation also involves assessing whether the plan identifies and addresses all the important impacts on the ecosystem. In fisheries management plans, strategies and references for pressures are likely to remain unchanged for the duration of the plan. However, as new understanding is gained, or when prevailing conditions alter the productivity of the resource, review and evaluation of strategies and references may be warranted. Tactics may be specified for the duration of the plan, or they may require regular intervention to set appropriate levels. Plan Enhancement Developing a robust plan that addresses the full range of ecosystem impacts of a given activity will take time and resources, and it is unlikely that data to support all elements will be available at the outset. In recognition of this, management plans should identify the main weaknesses of the plan, including weaknesses in the data needed for setting references for strategies, evaluating pressures relative to the references, and checking compliance with tactics. Management plans should also outline any data collection that is underway and the research required to make advances, noting the risks if not done.

Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Google,Fish and Overfishing," How are fish stocks changing across the world? How much is overfished? By: Hannah Ritchie and Max Roser This article was first published in October 2021 and last updated in March 2024. Many thanks to Ray Hilborn, Michael Melnychuk, Max Mossler, and Daniel Hively from the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database for providing data and feedback for this project. See all interactive charts on fish and overfishing ↓ Other research and writing on fish and overfishing on Our World in Data: The world produces around 200 million tonnes of fish and seafood every year. This comes from a combination of wild fish catch and fish farming. In fact, the rapid growth of aquaculture over the last few decades means we now produce more seafood from fish farms than we do from fisheries. Which countries produce the most seafood? We can break this down by wild catch and fish farming. But let’s first look at total production from the sum of these two methods. This is shown in the map here. China is the world’s largest seafood producer. The chart here shows the distribution of wild fish catch by country. This is total seafood production minus aquaculture (fish farming). By clicking on any country, you can see how its production has changed over time. The two charts here show the distribution of fish farming (also known as ‘aquaculture’) by country. First is the global distribution, as shown on the map. Second, as in the regional breakdown, you can also add and compare countries using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Most of the world’s growth in aquaculture production has come from East Asia and the Pacific. For example, China produces more food from aquaculture than any other country. This growth in aquaculture has played an important role in increasing global seafood production without sacrificing fish stocks. Production has continued to grow while the output of wild fisheries has slowed or even plateaued. This allows us to maintain sustainable fishing levels that do not deplete wild fish populations. Most records of global fish catch only date back decades. But, of course, fishing is an industry that dates back much further. We don't have good global records that go so far back in time, but we can draw upon data from some rich countries that have statistical records dating back centuries. This gives us insights into how modern-day fishing compares to the more distant past. In the chart here, we see five centuries of cod catch in Eastern Canada.1 These fishing records date back to the year 1500. We see that fish catch started to increase from around 1700 through to the mid-20th century. It peaked in 1968 before a collapse in fish stocks led to a dramatic decline. In fact, fisheries were forced to close 24 years later, in the early 1990s. Since then, stocks have not been able to recover due to the reopening of fisheries and their overexploitation afterward. Historical records from the UK give us a further understanding of the long-term trend in fisheries. In their paper, published in Nature, researchers Ruth Thurstan and colleagues reconstruct UK fisheries trends dating back more than a century.2 This measures the catch of bottom-dwelling fish – excluding shellfish. We see a steep rise in fish catch over the first half of the 20th century. The development of steam trawlers in the 1880s allowed vessels to fish further offshore, for longer periods of time, and with gear that could reach deeper into the ocean. This increase in fish catch was interrupted by the two World Wars: we see the dramatic declines in catch shown on the chart. This inter-war decline was due to a couple of factors: fishing became much more dangerous, and vessels were redirected from fishing towards military and other uses.3 Even after the World Wars, the fish catch began to dramatically decline over the second half of the 20th century. We might hypothesize that this decline was the result of reduced fishing efforts. But, this is not reflected in the data on fishing activity. When we look at the amount of fish caught per unit of fishing power (the number of fishing vessels multiplied by the fishing effort per vessel) we also see a dramatic decline. This shows the reduction in catch has been driven by a decline in the availability of bottom-living fish rather than changes in fishing efforts. Say the word ‘fishing’, and very different images come to mind. Some of us might picture a lone fisherman with a wooden fishing rod. Others will picture a 100-meter-wide net being dragged along the seafloor by an industrial ship. There are a variety of ways to catch fish. These matters because they depend on what fish we want to catch, how much fish we can catch (and ultimately, the amount of fish we have to eat and the income fishers get), and what the ecological impacts are. Discussions on fisheries can be full of jargon. If you’re not familiar with this research, it can be difficult to understand exactly what each method looks like and what it entails. To make this easier, I have created the following visualization, which presents an overview of the most common fishing methods. This is based on summary visuals from the Marine Stewardship Council. This gear is used across the world, but there are some general patterns where certain methods are more widely used. Pole-and-line, longline, and gillnet methods are more common in lower-income countries where much of the fishing activity is subsistence or small-scale. Purse seine and trawling methods are more common in industrial fishing practices; these tend to catch more fish per unit of effort. However, the downside is that they tend to have larger negative impacts, with more bycatch (catch of fish that are not the target species) and, in some cases, damage to the seabed. Now that we have some understanding of what each of these methods means, let’s look at how common each is. In the charts, we see the breakdown of global wild fish catch by the type of fishing gear used. This data is sourced from the Sea Around Us database, published by Daniel Pauly, Dirk Zeller, and Maria Palomares.4 Globally, bottom trawling is the most common method, accounting for one-quarter of fish catch. Pelagic (midwater) trawling accounts for an additional 10%. This means all types of trawling account for just over one-third of global fish catch. Purse seine fishing is the second most common method, accounting for just over 20% of the catch. Gillnets and longlines account for much less of global fish catch. This is partly a result of the fact that they achieve less catch per landing than methods such as trawling or purse seine. It’s interesting to see how common methods are across different countries. You can explore this data for any country using the + ‘Edit countries and regions’ on the interactive charts. For example, we see that bottom trawling is the dominant method used in China. In contrast, bottom trawling is becoming less common across Europe. In many countries – such as the UK, Spain, and Portugal – bottom trawling was intense throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s but has since declined significantly. That has been partly driven by efforts to reduce overfishing and allow fish stocks to rebuild. In addition, the European Commission banned bottom trawling in deep waters – those below 800m in depth – in 2016. In countries where most fishing is subsistent – Bangladesh is one example – it’s small-scale fishing practices that dominate. Large-scale practices are almost non-existent. Finally, we see that larger-scale practices are growing in some countries as they transition from small, subsistence fishing to larger industrial practices. In Ghana, for example, purse seine is one of the most common forms of fishing. Fish and seafood is an important source of nutrition for many people across the world. Not only does it provide an important source of protein, but fish also contains other nutrients and vitamins that are important for overall health, such as vitamin A, calcium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.5 How much fish do people across the world eat, and how much of our nutrition does it provide? Some countries in the world eat close to 100 kilograms of seafood per person each year. Others average only a few kilograms. In the charts here, we see the average per capita consumption of fish and seafood across the world.6 The highest seafood consumers are countries including Iceland, the Maldives, and Hong Kong. Contrast that with those at the bottom of the table: landlocked countries such as Mongolia, Afghanistan, and Niger understandably eat relatively little fish. There is a strong relationship between income and overall meat consumption: as we get richer, we tend to eat more meat. This relationship is not as strong for seafood. Many lower-income countries rely on subsistence fishing as a key food source. How much of our total protein, from plant and animal sources, comes from seafood? In the chart here, we see the per capita protein intake from different sources across the world. Globally, less than 10% of total protein intake comes from seafood.7 In some countries, it accounts for a much larger share: around one-third in the Maldives and one-fifth in Japan, Iceland, and Cambodia. It’s possible to get all of the protein we need from plant sources. However, to get all of the amino acids (the building blocks of protein) from a plant-based diet, one needs to have the right variety of foods. It requires a balance of staples such as cereals and more complete proteins such as legumes (peas and beans). Unfortunately, many in poorer countries are heavily reliant on cereals and lack this dietary diversity. In this case, animal protein sources can be vitally important for human health. So, how much of our animal protein comes from seafood? Globally, around one-sixth of our animal protein comes from seafood.7 In the charts here, we see the breakdown of animal protein consumption by country. In some countries, seafood dominates. It accounts for the majority of animal protein in Cambodia, Bangladesh, and the Maldives. For billions of people across the world, fish is an important source of nutrition. Fish plays an important role in nutrition for communities across the world. For many, it is a key source of high-quality protein and provides other vital micronutrients for health. However, people also rely on fishing and fish farming as primary sources of income. How many people are employed in these industries? The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates around 60 million people globally are employed as fishers (catching wild fish) or fish farming (aquaculture). The breakdown of employment by region and the split between fisheries and fish farming is shown in the chart. More people are employed in wild catch than fish farming: a difference of 39 million to 21 million. Unsurprisingly, Asia is home to most of the world’s fishers and fish farmers. The following chart shows us how employment has changed over recent decades. Globally, employment in the industry has increased, but with much faster growth in aquaculture. In 1995, fish farming was a relatively small industry, but it has grown rapidly in the last few decades. More of our seafood now comes from aquaculture than from wild catch. Employment in fishing has increased in every region except Europe. The number of fishers across Europe peaked around the year 2000 and has markedly declined since then [you can view these trends by region using the blue “Change region” button]. The seafood industry is not only an important source of nutrition for many; it is also a key source of income for millions of people. Both those employed directly as fishers or fish farmers and those employed through indirect jobs such as food processing, sourcing, and the management of fisheries. Is the global fishing industry sustainable? Which types of fish are we harvesting sustainably, and where are we overfishing? These are critical questions, but to answer them, we need to first agree on what ‘sustainability’ actually means when it comes to fishing. One of the biggest conflicts I see is not actually about technical discussions of how much fish we catch or whether populations are increasing or decreasing, but a larger ethical conflict in how we view fish. When we view fish through different lenses, these debates don’t get very far. One school of thought views fish as animals with their own inherent value. In this realm, our end goal is often to restore wild animal populations to as close to their pre-human levels as possible. Ultimately, this means we should be catching very little (if any at all). The other school of thought views fish as a resource. Most of us eat fish; hundreds of millions rely on it for nutrition and income across the world. This is incompatible with restoring populations to their historical levels because we can’t do that and catch lots of fish at the same time. Sustainability, in this view, means catching as many fish as possible without depleting fish populations any further. This ties in with the classic Brundtland definition of sustainability: “meeting the needs of the current generation, without sacrificing the needs of future generations”. We catch as many fish as possible to meet the needs of people alive today but don’t take too much such that populations decline, and this sacrifices catch for future generations. We can see these two schools of thought emerge in the typical diagram of sustainable fishing. On the x-axis, we have fishing pressure; as we move towards the right, we catch a larger proportion of the fish stock each year. Fishing pressure tells us about the fraction of the fish population that is caught in a given year. Note that this measure is a flow – it is an input variable that changes over time. On the y-axis, we have fish biomass, which is given as two variables. First, we have the fish catch – shown as the red line. This, again, is a flow variable. Second, we have fish stocks. The fish stock is the total amount of fish left in the population. It, as we'd expect, is a stock variable. Let’s first look at the ‘stock’ line. This is the amount of fish we have in the oceans. It slopes downwards towards the right: if we fish very little, then lots of fish are left in the ocean, and as we increase fishing pressure, we deplete the amount of fish in our oceans. This makes sense. Our first school of thought – that fish are not a resource but a wild animal population in their own right – suggests we should be aiming for the top-left corner. Fish populations are as close to pre-human levels as possible. To do this, we need to catch very little (if any) fish. Our second school of thought – that fish are a resource – would consider the optimal level to be the red dot. This is what is called the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. This is a key concept in fishery research and industry. It’s the largest long-term average catch that can be taken from a fish stock under prevailing environmental and fishery conditions. If you get greedy and catch more than this, then you deplete populations for future generations. If you catch too little, then you’re sacrificing food and income for the current generation. Most fisheries are aiming for this sweet spot: catching not too much, not too little, just right. The tension between these two schools becomes obvious. The optimal outcome is completely different. When the biomass of a fish stock is at the point where the ‘maximum sustainable yield’ can be achieved, it’s around half of its original virgin biomass.8 This level can vary between fish populations but is typically in the range of 37% to 50% of its pre-fishing levels. This may seem counterintuitive, but wild animal population growth rates are often greatest when the population size is moderate and before the population starts to reach its natural limit, or carrying capacity. In other words, if you view fish as a resource, you probably want fish populations to be less than half the size of pre-fishing size in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield. Most of the research, industry, and policymaking is geared towards the second school: viewing fish as a resource. Therefore, much of our work on fish on Our World in Data will explore these concepts and explain what the research and data tell us about fish stocks, catch, and the sustainability of fishing across the world. However, we will also offer the perspective of the first school by looking at how fish populations have changed from their pre-human levels. Sustainable fishing, by its fisheries definition, is catching just the right amount. If you harvest too much, then fish stocks decline. If you catch too little, then you’re giving up valuable food resources and income. In the previous section, we take a closer look at different concepts of sustainable fishing and how this ‘sweet spot’ – the maximum sustainable yield – is defined. How much of the world’s fish is caught sustainably? This is often measured in terms of fish stocks. A fish stock is a subpopulation of a particular species of fish with common parameters such as location, growth, and mortality. Often, it’s a species of fish in a given location. Indian Ocean tuna, for example. Importantly, this metric treats each fish stock as being equal, regardless of how big each stock is. A stock where we catch 1000 tonnes is counted the same as a stock where we catch 10 tonnes. When defining the sustainability of fisheries, we need to know three terms: Overfished: this is sometimes termed ‘overexploited’. A fish stock with abundance below the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is potentially considered ""overfished"". Fish stocks become overexploited when fish are caught at a rate higher than the fish population can support. Maximally sustainably fished: this has sometimes been termed ‘fully fished’ or ‘fully exploited’ in the past. Some might interpret these terms negatively, but this is actually the ‘sweet spot’ that fisheries are aiming for. This is the maximum sustainable yield, where we’re catching as much fish as possible without reducing fish populations below the most productive level. Underfished: this is when the fish stock is greater than the biomass that would produce the maximum sustainable yield. We could catch more fish without the decline of fish populations. From a resource point of view, this is suboptimal because we’re missing out on a key food source and income source from fishing communities. The breakdown of these three categories is shown in the chart. Combined, underfished and maximally fished would be considered to be sustainable because fish stocks are not declining. One-third (34%) of assessed global fish stocks were overfished in 2017. However, 60% were maximally fished, and 6% were underfished. But this does not tell us how much fish was sourced sustainably. This is because fish stocks can be very different sizes. Let’s say we have two fish stocks. Stock A is sustainable, and we’re catching 80 tonnes of fish per year. Stock B is unsustainable, and we’re catching 20 tonnes from it. If we aggregate them, we’d conclude that only half of our fish stocks are sustainable, but 80% of our catch is. When we adjust for the different amounts of catch from each stock, we find that almost four-fifths (79%) of fish catch is sourced sustainably. 21% of the catch comes from overfished populations. Overall, two-thirds of assessed fisheries are sustainable, providing four-fifths of our seafood. This gives us a static view of global fisheries, but how has this been changing over time? Are things getting worse? The chart here shows the status of the world’s fish stocks from the 1970s. The share of overfished stocks has increased over the last half-century. In the 1970s, around 10% were overexploited. Although exploitation rates varied year-to-year, this generally increased through the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Over recent decades, there has been some variability, but overfishing has hovered around one-third globally. Some regions are fishing much more sustainably than others. In the following section, we look at which are managing well and which are doing poorly. Sometimes, there are claims that seem so far-fetched that it’s hard to imagine they need to be addressed. But this is one that simply won’t die – it has been repeated so many times that many believe it to be true. It hit the headlines again after being featured in the popular Netflix documentary Seaspiracy earlier this year. It made the claim that: ""If current fishing trends continue, we will see virtually empty oceans by the year 2048"". Seaspiracy is far from the first source to repeat this claim: Google “empty oceans by 2048,” and you will find hundreds of thousands of results. What’s the story here? Where did this claim come from, and is it true? In 2006, the fisheries researcher Boris Worm and his colleagues published a paper in Science on the trends in biodiversity loss in the world’s oceans.9 The year 2048 and prospects for ‘global collapse’, were only mentioned once and featured in the conclusion of the article: Our data highlight the societal consequences of an ongoing erosion of diversity that appears to be accelerating on a global scale. This trend is of serious concern because it projects the global collapse of all taxa currently fished by the mid–21st century (based on the extrapolation of regression to 100% in the year 2048). How did they reach this conclusion? Well, they plotted the historical decline in ‘collapsed taxa’, as shown in the chart. If we take this black trend line and continue extrapolating it into the future, it will cross 100% in 2048. In other words, if we assume taxa continued to collapse at a constant rate, it would reach zero by mid-century. This raises the important question of what the authors meant by the term ‘collapse’ and how it was calculated. They defined a ‘collapse’ as the case where fish catch was below 10% of their historical recorded maximum. Their data came from the UN FAO database on fisheries ‘landings’ (the amount of fish brought back to land). At the time, there was a lack of high-quality data on fish abundance, so there was only catch data to go on. Unfortunately, this somewhat broad-brush projection was the highlight picked up by the media. The New York Times ran the headline “Study Sees 'Global Collapse' of Fish Species"", and coverage snowballed from there. Even if the authors’ projection did come true, and fisheries did collapse by 2048, the leap to “the oceans will be empty in 2048” is scientifically implausible. The definition of a fisheries collapse is not an ocean of no fish. Catch may be low because populations have been depleted. But there are clearly still fish: we're still catching them. Obviously, this is not an optimal place to be, whether you care about the fish or the fishers. But it does not mean an empty ocean. As we will see later, this prediction has not played out in reality. The aftermath of their paper in 2006 created a lot of uproar in the fishery research community. There were many rebuttal papers challenging this position. The research community had previously been divided: one camp had a more optimistic take on the status of the world’s fisheries and prospects for the future; one had a more pessimistic take. Boris Worm fell into the latter. To their credit, these two sides soon joined forces, working collaboratively to get a much larger and more rigorous overview of the status of the world’s fish populations. The figureheads on both sides of the debate – Ray Hilborn and Boris Worm – both featured in a debate on National Public Radio. In the aftermath, they formed a collaborative project facilitated by the National Center for Ecological Synthesis and Analysis (NCEAS) to get to the bottom of it. Rather than relying on reported data on fish catch, the scientists set out to build a database on global fish stocks. This does not focus on the amount of fish being caught but the abundance of fish in each population. Scientists can do this through a combination of sonar acoustic methods (which lets them build a picture of the number and density of fish) and fishing (which lets them identify specific species in the ecosystem). They published their results in 2009 in the journal Science.10 They concluded that although around two-thirds of assessed fisheries are below the biomass that would give us the maximum sustainable yield, catch is now within or even below sustainable levels in 7 of the 10 studied ecosystems. In other words, while many stocks are still in a poor state, things are improving across many ecosystems. The decline that Worm et al. projected in their earlier paper has not come true. Many fisheries are in a stable position and do not follow the projected curve of collapse. The divergence of these two trends is shown in the chart. First, in red, we see the observations in the Worm et al. (2006) paper from UN FAO catch data. We see that by extrapolating the trend line, it will reach 100% in 2048. In blue, we see the more recent data from Worm and Hilborn’s collaboration on fish stock (abundance) data. It shows a more stable trend in collapse stocks over the last few decades. This mirrors the UN FAO's assessment of fisheries. It estimates that around one-third of the world’s fish stocks are overexploited: these populations are declining because we’re catching more fish than can reproduce. The other two-thirds, though, are sustainable and not in decline. The share that is overexploited has been relatively stable in recent decades. It has not continued at the rates predicted. The most recent analysis of global fish stocks – published by the same group in 2020 – reaffirms this result.11 There are certainly fish stocks that are of major concern. But overall, the majority of regions where we have high-quality data are at least stable.12 To be clear, this does not undermine the fact that some of the world’s fish populations are struggling. Many are in trouble and are at risk of collapse if we do not take action. But the notion that the world’s fisheries will collapse within decades is wrong. Even the original authors do not stand by this statement.13 The extrapolation of this original claim to the “oceans will be empty by 2048” is nonsense that does not reflect the science that underpins it. The health of the world’s fish populations is one of our biggest concerns when it comes to the sustainability of fishing. Compared to other meats, seafood has a low environmental footprint when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and nutrient pollution – we looked at this later on. But with wild fish populations, we have another dimension to consider: what’s happening to their population numbers. When we catch fish faster than they can reproduce, these numbers decline. Earlier on, we looked at assessments of overfishing, and we found that around one-third of global fish stocks are overfished. [A ‘fish stock’ is a fish population in a given location – Bluefin Tuna in the Pacific Ocean, for example]. This is useful but doesn’t really tell us how fish stocks around the world are doing. As consumers, we want to know what types of fish to buy or where to source them. At the industry, national, or global level, we want to know this so we can take action on the stocks that are not doing well. What do we know about the health of fish stocks across the world? There are several methods we use to better understand the health of fish stocks. One method is small-scale scientific surveys in specific regions. This certainly gives us some indication of fish populations, but they are often localized and don’t give us a complete health profile. The second is to do large-scale stock assessments. These assessments have become the bedrock of fisheries management. The RAM Legacy database – first launched in 2009 – is led by a team at the University of Washington – and is the most widely used in research and is adopted by the UN Fisheries Division. Back in 2009, it covered 166 of the world’s fish stocks, which accounted for around 20% of global fish catch.10 Today, it covers over 1,200 fish stocks, which is more than 50% of the global catch. It covers many of the world’s key fishing regions: the United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Europe, Peru, Chile, Argentina, high-seas tuna fisheries, New Zealand, and Japan, plus most of the major fisheries of South Africa and Australia. Unfortunately, there are key regions where we have very little data. The database is missing data from most Asian, African, and Latin American fisheries. We see this in the map, which details the coverage of fish stocks in the RAM database. Most fisheries across Europe and the Americas have good coverage. Most fisheries across Asia do not. We will soon look at what’s happening to fish stocks in the regions for which we have good data. But first we should see what we know (if anything) about the stocks that are missing. Stock assessments are used by fisheries across the world to understand the health of fish populations and implement strategies to manage their fisheries. For example, they might be used to set catch limits at levels that are sustainable, given the dynamics and health of the fish population. They are carried out using the ‘ABC’ method. This is the collection of three key metrics: A = Abundance. Scientists use acoustics and other methods to monitor and estimate the abundance of fish at any given time. B = Biological factors. Sampled fish are taken to assess the age and population growth rate of the population. For example, we might need to know the ratio of adult versus juvenile fish to estimate the reproduction rate of the population. C = Catch. Data is collected on how many fish are being caught. Scientists then used these three inputs – abundance, biology, and catch – to model the population dynamics of the fish stock. Abundance and biology tell us how many fish we would otherwise expect to be there before we remove any. Catch tells us how many we’re taking out. The balance of these two gives us an estimate of how many there really are. We don't have good stock assessments across Asia, Africa (except South Africa), and much of Latin America. But can we say anything about how they might be doing? Well, first, the very fact that we don’t have good data is itself bad news. Managing the sustainability of fisheries is a delicate process – to do it well we need continual monitoring of the fish populations, their reproduction rate, and how much fish we’re catching. This balance can change from season to season or even month to month as environmental factors change and affect the dynamics of the ecosystem. Regions that manage fisheries well are constantly monitoring and changing catch limits when necessary. Fisheries that are not carrying out these assessments will struggle to maintain this balance. That’s most of the fisheries across Asia, Africa, and South America. Fishing pressure in many of these regions is intense. Bottom-trawling – where large fishing nets are dragged along the seabed – is very high in countries such as China, India, and Indonesia. Maintaining such high rates of fishing without monitoring them closely makes it unlikely that fish stocks are in a healthy state. One of the ways that we can assess the pressure from trawling is to look at how many times a given area of the seabed is trawled. Some areas are only trawled once every few years. Others are trawled over and over. Research suggests that where stocks are healthy, a net only passes over the same spot once in a period of 3 to 10 years. Across Asia, it’s common for the same area to be trawled 3 to 10 times per year. This has been confirmed by some smaller scientific surveys in the region. Scientific surveys have periodically monitored stocks in the Gulf of Thailand for decades. They show a large reduction in fish stocks over time. Other surveys of trawling efforts across the region show similar declines. Ask local experts about the state of fish stocks, and most have a similar take: they are in poor condition.14 Of course, it won’t apply to all fisheries across these regions. Some will be well-managed and healthy. But, based on what we know (and especially the fact that we don’t know a lot), the consensus is that many of these fish stocks are not in a healthy place. Let’s then turn to the health of fish across the regions for which we do have good assessments. It so happens that these tend to be richer countries: those across Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan. This database covers over 1,200 of these fish stocks, over half of the world’s fish catch. In the chart, we see how these stocks are doing. It shows the biomass of fish populations. That is, essentially, the amount of wild fish there. It’s the number of fish multiplied by their mass. Here, we’re measuring these stocks relative to the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. The maximum sustainable yield is the sweet spot where we can catch as many fish as possible without reducing the fish population below the most productive level. A value of one is the ‘optimal’. We’re maximizing fish catch while keeping populations stable. A value greater than one is good for fish populations (there are more fish) but not good for humans since we’re missing out on fish catch. A value below one is not good: fish stocks are lower than we’d like, and while we might catch more fish in the short term, we will miss out in the longer term. You can add more regions using the “Edit countries and regions” button. Fish stocks are healthy across most of these regions. Australia, Alaska, the US Northeast and Southeast Coasts, Japan, and Europe Atlantic are all above one another, hovering around this optimal value. However, there are a few regions that are not doing so well. The Canadian East Coast has seen a large decline in recent years. Assessed stocks in South America and Africa are struggling. The European Mediterranean is not doing well. This is reflected in the fact that the Black Sea is very overfished. Whether a fish stock is doing well or not is mainly determined by its fishing intensity: what fraction of the population is being caught each year. Fish too much, and the population can’t be maintained. In this chart, we see levels of fishing intensity across the same regions. Again, this is measured relative to the intensity at the ‘maximum sustainable yield’. An optimal value is one. If the intensity is greater than one, then we’re overfishing. Fish stocks tend to be a lagging indicator of fishing intensity. So, if we hold fishing intensity too high (above one) – even if only slightly – then stocks will inevitably fall below one until fishing pressures are reduced. The status of stocks across different regions might tell us where we might find healthy stocks – and, as a result, where we might want to source our fish from – but they’re averaged across many types of fish. It doesn’t tell us about what fish we might want to buy or avoid. How are stocks of tuna, cod, mackerel, or sharks holding up? In the chart, we see the same metric as before – fish stocks measured by biomass – across different types. Across most of the main fish groups – tunas, shrimp, cod, and perch – stocks are at or above ‘one’ – the sweet spot where we catch as many fish as possible while keeping populations stable. That’s good news. Many of our most popular stocks are well-managed and have healthy populations. A few groups are not faring so well. In recent years, mackerel have dropped below the optimal level due to increased fishing intensity. And sharks are declining rapidly – a worrying trend. Let’s look at a few of these species in more detail: tuna, which is doing surprisingly well, and sharks, which are not. The health of tuna populations has been a concern for decades. We often hear that tuna are being overfished to extinction. That we should avoid them if we want to eat sustainably. But many tuna populations are now well-managed. Previously, we looked at the aggregate of tuna stocks; we can zoom in further and look at particular regional stocks. In the chart, we see the health of fish stocks across three oceans: the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Tunas in the Atlantic and Pacific are managed close to their ‘maximum sustainable yield’. That’s positive news. The trend looks worse for those in the Indian Ocean. Its stocks have now fallen below one and look to be continuing downwards. Atlantic and Pacific tuna might be a reasonable fish choice. Tuna from the Indian Ocean has less of a guarantee of being from a sustainable source. However, we can go even further and look at specific tuna species, such as bluefin or yellowfin. We see these stocks in the chart. Some tuna stocks have recovered through improved management – especially in the US and European waters. From the chart, we see that many are above one: the maximum sustainable yield. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. Many of the tuna stocks that were the biggest concern have started to turn things around. We see this in this chart, which now shows fish stocks measured as their total mass in tonnes rather than relative to the maximum sustainable yield. Throughout the 1960s to 1990s, we see a massive decline in tuna populations. The Southern bluefin tuna by more than 90% – from over 8.5 million tonnes to less than one million. The Western Pacific yellowfin fell by three-quarters. However, since the millennium, better management of fisheries and reduced overfishing have resulted in many of these stocks showing some signs of recovery. Interactive visualization requires JavaScript. While many of the world’s tuna stocks might be starting to recover, shark populations are declining. We previously saw that shark stocks were being overexploited and populations were declining. We see this again in the chart here. What’s even more concerning is that this only tells us about assessed shark populations. Many more stocks have not been assessed – and these are likely to be in regions where monitoring is poor and illegal catch is poorly regulated. There, shark populations might be in even poorer health. In general, sharks and rays tend to grow and reproduce more slowly than other fished species, meaning that it takes longer for individuals who have been caught to be replaced. This contributes to their increased extinction risk, reflected in the IUCN Red List. A third of the world's sharks and rays have been assessed as being threatened with extinction15. However, this slow rate of growth and reproduction is not true of all shark and ray species, and some species can support sustainable fisheries 16. In our Fish Stocks Data Explorer, we present the key metrics for assessed fish stocks from the RAM Legacy Database.17 This provides a high-resolution breakdown of specific fish stocks across the world. For general readers, this might be too detailed. However, it could be useful for those with a background in this area to explore specific fish stocks. One of the best ways to reduce our impact on the environment is by changing what we eat. The research shows us that we can have the biggest impact by eating less meat and dairy. Or substituting lower-impact meats such as chicken and pork for beef and lamb. But I’m often asked the question: “What about fish and seafood? Is that an environmentally-friendly option?”. There are lots of types of seafood: not only different species but also ways of producing them. We can catch them in the wild or grow them in fish farms. But in most comparisons of food products, they’re aggregated into one or two categories, such as “marine fish” or “freshwater fish”. This doesn’t really inform us about what type of fish to eat. Let’s take a closer look at the impacts of specific types of seafood. ‘Environmental impact’ can mean very different things: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use or chemical pollution. It’s useful to look at all of these impacts in case there are large trade-offs between them. In a new study published in Nature, Jessica Gephart and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of the impacts of fish and seafood across multiple environmental metrics.18 To do this, they combined life-cycle analysis data from studies of wild-caught and farmed seafood products. It covered over 1690 fish farms and 1000 records from fisheries. These results look at the impacts on-farm and off-farm, up to the farmgate. That means up to the point that harvested or caught fish are brought back to land. It includes all of the inputs into production, such as fish feed or fuel use in fisheries. It does not include post-farm processes such as transport to retail, packaging, or cooking.19 Here, we’re looking at five key metrics: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, freshwater use, and nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This doesn’t include the sustainability of wild fish stocks, which is obviously another important metric that we need to consider. We looked at what’s happening to global fish stocks earlier on this page. The impacts across the seafood products are shown in the charts. Here, we’re looking at the median across all of the assessed studies.20 These impacts are shown per kilogram of edible weight. That means we’re not including inedible parts such as shells or bones. Comparing fish to other types of fish is useful. But we also want to know how seafood compares to other protein foods. So, we’ve included chicken for comparison.21 Chicken tends to have the lowest environmental impact of meat and dairy products – much less than beef and lamb and a bit better than pork. So when we make this comparison, we’re really seeing how seafood compares to animal protein with the lowest impact. Overall, we see that a lot of seafood has a relatively low environmental impact compared to animal protein sources. Many types have a lower carbon footprint than chicken (those that are higher are around 20-30% higher). Most farmed seafood needs less land and freshwater and causes less nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. This is because fish tend to be more efficient than chickens in converting feed into meat, which means they need less feed per kilogram. There are some exceptions, though: wild flounder, lobster, and shrimp, for example, can have a high carbon footprint. More than double that of chicken. Related chart: Looking at the median footprints allows us to make quick, general assessments of the high- and lowest-impact species. However, they can hide the variability among a given species based on where and how it’s produced. This makes little difference for some species, but for others, it can have a large impact. In the chart, we see the spread of greenhouse gas emissions among the different types of seafood. The median of each – as we looked at above – is shown as the thick black line for each bar. The width of the bar shows us how variable this can be: it tells us what the largest and smallest impact can be for each species. Wild-caught seafood is shown in blue; farmed seafood is in red. Now we see that not only are there large differences in the median between each. There are also large differences in how variable emissions can be. In general, we tend to see that the impacts of farmed seafood are much less variable than wild-caught; the red bars are much thinner than the blue. Let’s take salmon as an example. The median emissions for farmed and wild-caught salmon are similar; farmed has a slightly lower footprint of 5.1 versus 6.9 kg CO2e per kg. But the big difference comes from the spread of emissions: wild-caught can range anywhere from 1.7 to 17 kg CO2e. That’s a ten-fold difference. Farmed salmon only ranges from 4.1 to 6.2 kg CO2e, a 50% difference between the minimum and maximum. If you choose wild-caught salmon, you could be picking a low-carbon or a high-carbon protein source. It might even be lower than farmed salmon. But if you pick farmed salmon, you are almost guaranteed that it will be relatively low-carbon. We see this across other species, too: see shrimp, for example. The same is true in our comparison to chicken. Chickens have a very low footprint variation. Wild-caught fish such as salmon or tuna can have a lower or higher footprint depending on where and how it’s caught. Some choices that will guarantee a relatively low footprint are farmed bivalves (mussels, oysters, and scallops) and seaweed – these are filter-feeding organisms that also sequester carbon and nutrients in their shells. That is partly why they have such low emissions, and they need no additional land either. Farmed salmon, trout, carp, and catfish are also good choices. What do these results tell us about how seafood fits into a sustainable diet? Again, we should be clear that the most effective way to reduce the impact of your diet is to eat less animal-sourced products overall. On the basis of total protein and calories, plant-based foods such as legumes and soy still have a much lower impact. However, for those who do not want to eliminate animal products completely, seafood can be a good choice. Many types of seafood have a lower impact than chicken. This means they have a much lower impact than foods such as beef or lamb. As we saw earlier on this page, the status of wild fish stocks is mixed. Effective management of fisheries across Europe and North America means that many of these fish stocks are stable and no longer in decline.11 Unfortunately, we know much less about the health of fish stocks across Asia and much of Africa, but many of these stocks are likely to be overfished. That matters for where you source wild-caught fish; sourcing from European or American fisheries might be a safer choice if you want to ensure they are sustainable. The issue of wild fish stock depletion is not an issue for farmed seafood. As these fish tend to also have a low carbon and land footprint, farmed fish can be a low-impact source of protein. Most of the fishing methods we use have some kind of environmental impact – whether it’s burning fuel in fishing boats, unintentionally catching fish or marine animals we don’t want (bycatch), or leaving behind remnants of fishing gear. But dredging – sometimes referred to as bottom trawling – has the largest negative impact. Bottom trawling drags a structure along the seabed – at various depths in the sediment, depending on the specific method – to dislodge organisms such as crustaceans. It’s an incredibly efficient way to catch seafood. That’s why it’s so common: one-quarter of the world’s fish are caught this way. But it usually comes at an environmental cost. In this section, we look at how much of the seafloor is trawled, what the consequences are, and what we can do to reduce its impacts. Let’s first look at the question of how much of the seafloor is affected by trawling. Improved satellite and GPS tracking technologies mean that scientists can now map trawling patterns at high resolution. In a paper published in Nature, Enric Sala and colleagues estimate that around 5 million square kilometers (km2) of seabed is trawled each year.22 In the chart below, I’ve put this into the context of the global seabed area as a whole. The total ocean seabed spans 361 million km2.23 That’s the top bar in the chart. Most of this is deep ocean, far from the world’s continents, and at depths that we rarely visit. Around 10% of the world’s seabed is shallower than 1000 meters – this threshold includes all of the world’s continental shelves and areas that we’d fish in. That means 37 million km2 of seabed is within our scope. That is shown by the second bar. Our 5 million km2 of trawled seabed – shown as the bottom bar – is therefore equal to around 13.5% of the explorable seabed. In the context of the total seabed area, it’s 1.4%. Many have compared this area to the Amazon Rainforest.24 To some extent, the areas do match: the Amazon rainforest spans approximately 5 million km2. But we should be careful about using this comparison. Trawling does not have the same impact as cutting down a primary rainforest. As we will soon see, trawling does kill a lot of life on the seabed, but recovery times can be very quick: in the order of a few months to years. When we cut down the primary rainforest, we lock ourselves into a recovery period of many decades. Maybe even longer. What’s also important to note is that the same areas are often trawled again and again.25 What this means is that it’s not a different 5 million km2 that’s trawled every year. If that were true, within five years, almost all of the shallow seabed would be trawled. Thankfully, that’s not the case. The extent of trawling varies a lot from region to region. In a study published in PNAS, Ricardo Amoroso and colleagues mapped the extent of trawling across different regions.26 They monitored the share of continental shelves – to a depth of 1000m – that was trawled at least once during a period of two to four years.27 Some regions – such as South Chile, Alaska, and the Australian shelves – experienced almost no trawling at all. Others experienced a lot. 80% of the continental shelf in the Adriatic Sea was trawled. 42% of the North Sea was trawled. One-quarter of the shelf in the Irish Sea was. You can see these rates by region here. Passing a trawl over the seabed can have quite a severe impact on the organisms that live there. How much of the biota is affected depends on a couple of factors, including the type of gear used, the type of sediment, and what lifeforms live there. We might imagine that a coral that sticks out from the seabed will be destroyed while organisms deeper in the sediment might survive. Researchers have carried out studies to see what impact trawling has on wildlife – either through experimental methods or observing real-world impacts. In an analysis published in PNAS, Jan Geert Hiddink and colleagues brought these experiments together to build a complete picture.28 The impact of trawling really depends on the type of method and gear that’s used. We see that in the chart below, which shows the impact of four types: otter trawling, beam trawling, towed dregs, and hydraulic dredging. On the y-axis, we have the share of organisms that are removed or killed by a single pass of a trawl over the seabed. On the x-axis, we have the depth of the ocean sediment that the trawl reaches. What we see clearly is that the deeper the trawl digs into the sediment, the more biota we kill. Otter trawls have the lowest impact: they dig just 2.4 centimeters into the sediment, and around 6% of organisms are lost. Beam trawls lose 14%. Towed dredges dig twice as deep, and one-fifth of organisms are killed off. The most damaging method is hydraulic dredging: it digs deep into the sediment at 16 centimeters, and 41% of organisms are destroyed as a result. Once this area has been affected by trawling, how long does it take for its biodiversity to recover? For the ecosystem to get back to its pre-trawling state takes a few years if it’s left alone. In their analysis, Hiddink and colleagues found average recovery times (where ‘recovery’ means getting back to 95% of pre-trawling biomass levels) in the range of 1.9 to 6.4 years. The differences here were dependent on the method used – the shallower otter trawls caused less damage and recovered more quickly than the deep hydraulic trawling – and the environmental context, such as the type of seabed. This finding was consistent with previous studies, finding recovery to be in the range of years [this study, for example, reports a 4-5 year recovery time across multiple commercial trawling sites].29 Several years might seem like a long time, but it’s actually pretty fast for an ecosystem to recover. This is why I don’t find the comparison between dredging and rainforest clearing to be a particularly helpful one. If we cut down the Amazon rainforest, it will be decades, if not centuries, before it gets back to its previous state. Thankfully, these seabed communities recover orders of magnitude more quickly. But, of course, they only recover if we leave them alone. How is bottom trawling changing across the world? Is it becoming more or less common? Globally, bottom trawling rapidly increased through the second half of the 20th century. But it has not changed much since the 1990s. We see this in the chart. What has changed is where bottom trawling is happening. Trawling rates were very high across Europe in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s. However, growing concern about the depletion of wild fish stocks has led to a significant reduction in recent decades to allow populations to recover. The cases of the UK, Portugal, and Spain are shown in the chart. Portuguese catch from bottom trawling has fallen by 90% since the 1960s.30 In 2016, the European Commission also banned bottom trawling in deeper water below 800 meters. We see the same in Japan, where the catch peaked in 1972 at 4 million tonnes and has since fallen by around 90% to 400,000 tonnes. Bottom trawling has been growing elsewhere, though. It has been growing rapidly in China and India since the 1980s. Although these rates have stabilized – or even declined – in the last few years. Since most methods of trawling create environmental damage, you might suggest that the best option is to eliminate it completely. But in reality, it is still the most efficient method of catching seafood – which is why so many countries continue to use it. We can limit the use of trawling, which, in fact, many countries have. We just saw examples of this across Europe and Japan. But this will come at the cost of catch and income for communities that rely on it. If we can’t – or don’t want to – eliminate it completely, there are still things we can do to limit its impacts. The types of gear used for trawling can have very different impacts. Some are much more damaging than others. One option is, therefore, to ban specific types of gear rather than completely ban the practice. Another option is to modify the types of gear used to limit their damage to the seabed. For example, the doors on otter trawls are very destructive; newer designs now limit the amount of impact these doors have on the seafloor. In some cases, they eliminate this contact completely. Finally, we can ban trawling in specific locations where the habitat is particularly sensitive. For example, not allowing trawling in areas with coral reefs or important biodiverse habitats such as seagrasses. This would allow trawling activity to continue but would protect important areas of our ocean at the same time. Fish farming – also known as aquaculture – has boomed over the last 50 years. Production has increased more than 50-fold. In fact, we now produce more seafood from aquaculture than we do from wild catch. This has been good news for the health of global fish stocks. Global demand for seafood might have increased, but wild fish populations are finite. If we push beyond the limits of how quickly fish populations recover, this becomes unsustainable. Aquaculture has, therefore, been an ingenious solution: rather than relying on wild fish, we can produce our own. Nearly all of the growth in seafood production in recent decades has come from aquaculture; wild fish catch has changed very little. However, there has been one concern about the rise of aquaculture in relation to wild fish stocks. Like any type of animal farming, we need to feed them. Sometimes, we feed them fishmeal and fish oils. Not all aquaculture species are fed from animal sources, but many are. They don’t necessarily need fishmeal and oils in their diets, but fish farmers often use them because they provide an almost perfect balance of essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids. Many have questioned whether aquaculture is really the solution that it seems. If it is partly fed by wild fish, perhaps more fish farms means more pressure on wild fish stocks? Here, I take us through the numbers to understand how much wild fish catch really goes towards animal feed, how this is changing over time, and whether this undermines the benefits of aquaculture. Let’s first understand the amount of wild fish that is used as feed. In the chart, we see the breakdown of global fish catch in 2017.31 The world caught around 109 million tonnes of fish. 84% of this was used for direct human consumption. The remaining 16% was turned into fishmeal and oils to use as animal feed. 5% went to land-based livestock such as cows, pigs, and chickens. 11% went to aquaculture as feed for farmed fish. This bottom component is what we’re most interested in. In the second bar, we see global aquaculture production. We produce around 112 million tonnes of farmed seafood a year. We should be careful not to interpret this as the total input and output of feed for fish farming. It’s not the case that we put 12.6 million tonnes of feed in and magically get 112 million tonnes of fish back. That would massively overstate the efficiency of fish farms. First, fishmeal is just one of many things that we need to fish, so there are other inputs. Second, many aquaculture species are not fed fishmeal or oils at all. Only a small share of fish catch is used as feed for aquaculture today. However, aquaculture production has grown quickly. If we want to understand how sustainable this is, we need to know how the use of fish for feed has changed over time. In the chart, we see global fish catch since 1950.32  It is broken down by whether it is used for direct human consumption, animal feed, or other uses (which are mainly industrial uses of oils). First, we see that global fish catch has been relatively stable since 1990. If aquaculture was putting pressure on fish production, it’s not obvious from the total catch. When we look at the breakdown, we also see that the amount allocated to fishmeal and oil (animal feed) has not changed much since 1990. It increased a lot from the 1950s through to the 1980s. But since 1990, it has actually declined. This decline is seen even more clearly in this chart, which shows the amount of wild fish used as animal feed (in blue) and aquaculture production (in red).33 As we will see later, in its infancy, the aquaculture industry was inefficient. To produce one fish, you need several fish as feed inputs. That’s part of the explanation for why feed inputs in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s were higher than aquaculture production. Thankfully, aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has declined over the last few decades. This is for several reasons. First, the feed conversion and efficiency of fish farms have improved. Second, we’ve been discovering blends of plant-based ingredients that offer all of the essential nutrients; this reduces the need for fishmeal and oil. As we can see from the chart, aquaculture production increased by 250% between 2000 and 2015. Meanwhile, fish caught for feed actually declined. Aquaculture’s reliance on wild fish has been weakening. It’s not the case that more and more aquaculture puts more and more pressure on wild fish. There’s one key metric that we need to understand: the efficiency of fish feed and the FIFO ratio. The Fish In: Fish Out (FIFO) ratio tells us how much fish we need to feed aquaculture species to get one fish back in return. If you have a FIFO greater than 1, you need more fish inputs than you get back from your fish farm. So a ratio of 2 means you need two fish equivalents of fishmeal and oil to be able to produce one fish in return. On the flip side, a ratio of 0.5 means you get two fish back from every fish you put in. In the chart here, we see the FIFO ratio across all of the most common aquaculture species.34 At the bottom, we see the total across all species fed by fishmeal. This shows the change in FIFO in the two decades from 1997 (the red markers) to 2017 (blue markers). In 1997, aquaculture used fish feed very inefficiently. The overall ratio was 1.9, meaning almost two fish were required as inputs to produce one fish in return. This has improved massively in the decades since then. In 2017, this ratio was 0.28: we got three fish back from one fish used as input.35 This improvement came from efficiency gains, as well as a switch to other plant-based feed blends. The FIFO improved for all aquaculture species. Today, this ratio for the most common species – carp, tilapia, and catfishes, shown at the top – is incredibly low. They use very tiny amounts of fishmeal as inputs. On the other hand, farmed salmon, trout, and eel still have unfavorable ratios. This has improved significantly in recent decades but is still well above 1. Hopefully, this ratio will continue to fall. Overall, aquaculture is an important solution to meet the growing demand for seafood. We cannot take endless numbers of wild fish from our oceans, so if we want more fish, we’re going to have to produce our own. A few decades ago, aquaculture’s benefits were questionable. But with massive improvements in efficiency, it is now a net producer of seafood. Fears that a growing aquaculture industry would put more and more pressure on wild fish stocks have not come true. When fishers go out to catch fish, it would be great if they only caught the fish that they need. If they’re fishing for tuna, they catch their daily quota of tuna and leave the rest of the ecosystem undisturbed. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Fishers also catch marine life that they don’t want. Catch that is not the species we’re targeting is called by-catch. Fishers sometimes bring by-catch back to land to eat or sell. But often, they will throw these unwanted fish back into the water. The animals they throw back are called discards. Discards can be dead or alive, but the survival rate is low. Some hardy shellfish might survive, but most discarded fish are dead. There are various reasons why fishers might not want these fish. They might be too small, inedible, damaged, or not give them a good return in the market. Fishers might also have strict quota restrictions on how much they can bring back each day. If they’re over the limit, they will have to throw some fish back. Discards are obviously negative. First, there is the obvious ethical lens of animal welfare – not only are we killing animals, but we’re killing them without an end use or purpose. Killing for no reason. Second, this is an issue that is often hidden from official statistics. Only ‘landings’ – the fish brought back to land – are recorded in most databases, such as those of the UN fisheries. Discards are not reported. It’s hard to understand fish stocks if large numbers of fish kills are going unmonitored. Maintaining sustainable fish stocks relies on us understanding how quickly fish populations regenerate and balancing this with how much fish we catch. Hidden catches could tip this out-of-balance. Thankfully, we are not completely blind. Marine scientists do reconstruct and estimate discards. The UN Fisheries Division also carries out periodic – around once every decade  – assessments to understand the magnitude of the problem. Globally, we throw less than a tenth of the fish and marine animals we catch back into the ocean. We see this in the chart, which shows global fish catch since 1950. This is split into ‘landings’ – catch that is brought back to land – and ‘discards’, the catch that is thrown back into the ocean. Researchers Dirk Zeller, Daniel Pauly, and Maria Palomares can reconstruct this data from estimates of how many discards are captured from different fishing methods.36 For example, the percentage of catch from bottom trawls that ends up being discarded. Their web platform – Sea Around Us – is an excellent resource for understanding global fisheries. The chart shows that the majority of the aquatic animals are brought ashore and used for human or animal consumption. The remaining amount is thrown back into the water. The UN Fisheries Division did an independent assessment of discards and found a similar result.37 It estimated that annual discards (averaged from 2010 to 2014) were around 9.1 million tonnes. That was 10.8% of the total catch. The amount of fish we discard has declined a lot in recent decades. We see this in the other chart, which shows plots that have been discarded since 1950. In the early 1950s, we were throwing around 5 million tonnes of fish away. This increased to 14 million tonnes in 1989. Since then, discards have fallen to around 8 or 9 million tonnes. This is back to levels in the late 1950s. Some fishing methods generate much more discards than others. You’re not going to generate the same unwanted catch using a fishing rod as you are from bottom trawling – dragging a large net along the seafloor. If you’re doing the latter, you’re going to end up with lots of unwanted animals in your net. It’s difficult to discriminate for the particular species that you want. Researchers gather data on how much catch is discarded when different types of fishing gear are used. This gives us what is called the discard rate – what percentage of the total catch is thrown back into the water. The average results across different fishing methods are shown in the chart. Unsurprisingly, trawling has the highest discard rate; half of the catch from shrimp trawls is thrown back in. The fact that trawling tends to have a high discard rate, and it is the method used to catch a lot of our fish, means that around half of global fish discards come from bottom trawling. There are no big winners when it comes to discards. Fish are killed needlessly, and the fact that these fish are not sold or eaten means that no one benefits from more income or food. Reducing discards is a good thing. As we saw earlier, discards have fallen since the 1990s. Why have they declined,  and can we learn to replicate it? One factor has been a rising market value of fish – even the species that fishers do not intend to catch. Fishers are, therefore, incentivized to bring more of their bycatch to land and sell it. That means that even if bycatch did not decline, the amount of discards would. Some countries have implemented a no-discard policy – a ban on discards at sea.37 This is sometimes called a ‘landing obligation’, which means that fishers must keep all of their caught fish on board and bring them back to land to declare as ‘landings’. This policy was implemented by the European Union and was a core part of its Common Fisheries Policy reform in 2013. If fishers have a quota or limit on how much fish they can catch, they have to be much more careful about by-catch – these unwanted fish will still count towards their quota for the day. Improved gear has led to much more selective fishing practices. Over time, gear has been adapted to reduce by-catch. Examples of this include changes in the size and shape of mesh and hook, adding ‘escape panels’ to trap nets, or the use of underwater lights or acoustic alarms.38 This has been shown to be effective in multiple contexts.39 Some countries – Belize is one example – go as far as to ban non-selective fishing gear completely.40 Many of the effective solutions to reduce discards rely on effective monitoring and enforcement of fishery policies. This means that countries that have been successful so far tend to be those with strong fisheries policies. Others lag behind, but there’s no reason to think that they could not do the same. Eliminating by-catch completely might be unrealistic. But the fact that discards have been falling means that we can do something about it. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are areas of ocean – which includes the water column and seafloor – that have been reserved by law or other effective means to protect part or all of the enclosed environment. Regulations in marine protected areas can vary but include interventions such as no fishing zones, restrictions on fishing such as the type of gear that can be used, bans or restrictions on activities such as mining, and regulations on inputs to the ocean from rivers and industrial effluents. How much of the world’s ocean is protected today? Here, we have to differentiate between national territorial waters – that is, parts of the ocean typically closer to coastlines that countries have national rights over – and international waters (also called the ‘high seas’) that do not belong to any single country. In the chart, we see the amount in each zone that is protected and unprotected.41 As of 2021, 7.7% of the total ocean is protected. This means 92% is unprotected. We see that much more of the world’s national waters are protected than international ones. In the charts here, we see the share of territorial waters that are protected in each country. This does not include international waters (‘high seas’). Schijns, R., Froese, R., Hutchings, J. A., Pauly, D., & Raicevich, S. (2021).

Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Google,‘Phenomenal loophole’ in quotas could lead to massive overfishing," Exclusive: Drastically weakened rules on how vessels document their catches of endangered species could endanger the marine ecosystem, confidential EU papers reveal A push by EU fishing nations including France and Spain to weaken how fish catches are reported could see massive overfishing of endangered species and even “call into question” the whole point of setting quotas, according to confidential EU documents seen by the Guardian. Europe’s most commonly fished species – which include mackerel, tuna, Atlantic herring and sprat – could be threatened under the latest proposal, which would apply to all vessels in EU waters. At issue is how fish catches are logged to ensure that vessels are not overfishing. Bloc rules currently allow a 10% margin of tolerance between the declared catch for each fish species in a vessel’s logbook and the quantity they report after landing. But fishing nations want to expand a loophole applied to the Baltic in 2016 that widens the scope of the 10% margin to vessels’ total catches. Such a “phenomenal loophole” removes any penalty for vessels that submit completely inaccurate estimates for vulnerable fish species, according to one of the European Commission papers. The loophole has “incentivised hidden overfishing and even calls into question the usefulness of fishing conservation measures, such as quota setting, in a scenario where such quotas can be easily circumvented without any consequence”, the paper said. The papers, circulated to diplomats and parliamentary negotiators in February, added: “This derogation has led to huge misreporting, in particular underreporting and overfishing of quota species. Misreporting of catches is the precursor to unsustainable fishing, which over time risks resulting in depletion of fish stocks and ultimately to disruption of the marine ecosystem.” Preliminary EU audits found that misreporting in the Baltic last year was “incentivised” by the derogation and was accompanied by overfishing, another document says. Sprat, for example, is a species protected by a quota, but in samples from one EU state, sprat was underreported by 78%, while hauls of non-quota species were overreported by 819%, according to the audit, which is mentioned in the EU papers. The average underreporting of herring and sprat in another state were 36% and 63% respectively. Conservationists fear that such underreporting could have permanent repercussions on the vulnerable fish. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) committee, which gives the EU scientific advice on catch limits, has called for precautionary quotas to protect sprat populations in the Baltic. Massimiliano Cardinale, an adviser to ICES, said that applying the margin of tolerance to total catches put populations of smaller fish in jeopardy. “If you fish two stocks that have a very different biomass with a 10% total catch tolerance, you will have a much larger risk of overfishing the smaller population,” he said. “That’s just an obvious consequence.” Fish stocks most threatened by weakened reporting protocols include yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean, which thinktanks and marine scientists have warned could collapse by 2026 if overfishing continues. EU fishing boats scoop up around a third of the ocean’s tuna catch. They use a method called purse seine that uses nets about 2km long and 200m deep, which also trapnon-target species such as sea turtles, sharks and rays, according to the Global Tuna Alliance, an independent tuna industry association. They also trap mainly juvenile tuna, which make up 63-71% of the EU fleet’s yellowfin tuna catch using this purse seining method, depending on the time of year, according to October 2022 data from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Against this backdrop, entrenching the 10% reporting loophole would “legalise misreporting, in particular underreporting of several if not all quota species, erasing almost 40 years of improved accuracy of catch reporting in the EU, by bringing EU fishing standards back to 1983,” the first commission document says. It would also “go against” targets in the Cop15 agreement on nature protection. The quarrel is part of an internal EU haggle over modernising fisheries controls, which were proposed by Brussels in 2018 but challenged ever since by fishing nations such as France, Denmark and Spain. The EU’s environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, has compromised on plans to fit CCTV onboard all vessels, but made the loophole a red line. He has reportedly threatened to withdraw the entire legislative package in negotiations on Wednesday, according to two officials. Sinkevičius declined to comment. Europêche, the fishing industry trade group, argued that it is too difficult to apply the new rules to fleets fishing for species such as tropical tuna, and that the suspension of fishing licences and “immobilisation” of vessels after they have amassed too many penalty points is unfair. Defending the proposals, Daniel Voces, the managing director of Europêche, said: “The current provisions relating to the margin of tolerance are penalising our shipowners and skippers, particularly the tuna industry, who are facing extreme sanctions, the allocation of points and even risking losing their jobs due to the impossibility to comply with a rule that is unworkable for the industry in its current form. “If the problem is not fixed soon, I’m afraid the EU tuna purse seine fleet will disappear in a matter of years.” The marine conservation group Oceana disputed the scale of the cost posed to industry by the new rules. “Only a handful of serial offenders risk becoming unprofitable,” said Vanya Vulperhorst, Oceana’s campaign director. Giving in to them would be “a complete contradiction of the EU’s zero-tolerance policy to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, [and] put further at risk already overfished stocks such as yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean”.",2023-03-16

   TNC partnered with the Republic of the Marshall Islands, one of the world’s largest tuna fisheries, to establish Pacific Island Tuna, a sustainable seafood supplier that sources its catch from vessels with 100% monitoring and improved transparency. As designed, the first distribution of $100,000 from Pacific Island Tuna company was distributed to the Republic of the Marshall Islands in June to support conservation programs on Arno Atoll.

                                    Countries have made commitments to 100% monitoring in their large-scale fisheries
                                 Large-scale fishing occurs on more than half of the ocean’s surface—more than three times the area covered by land-based agriculture. Vessels in these fisheries are often fishing for highly commercialized species like tuna and shrimp. Large-scale fishing provides seafood that one in seven people around the world rely on for protein and supports millions of livelihoods. In most fisheries around the world, fishers are required to report their catch to government or supply chain entities, but this self-reporting is often unverifiable. This reality creates the conditions for many legally licensed fishing vessels to conduct widespread illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities such as misreporting and underreporting of the number and type of species caught; shark finning; and retention of endangered, threatened, and protected species. A deadly feedback loop has emerged between fishers, supply chain stakeholders, and governments that perpetuates illegal and unsustainable activities that directly threaten the health of our oceans and communities. Without accurate and timely data on fishing activity, we cannot responsibly manage our global fisheries.  To solve this issue, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is invested in Electronic Monitoring (EM)—the use of on-board video cameras, sensors, and GPS—to improve fisheries transparency and transform large-scale fisheries across the globe. EM is a proven tool that illuminates dark spots in fisheries and fills critical data gaps that impede transparency, enforcement, and science-based fisheries management. EM provides detailed data on fishing efforts, catch composition, bycatch of non-target species (i.e., sharks and sea turtles) and adherence to environmental and social commitments while at sea. EM also drives consumer confidence that seafood products have been harvested legally, sustainably and without labor abuses. Since 2015, TNC has been working across geographies to engage with fishery, government, and industry stakeholders to support improved fisheries transparency and advance EM uptake. Now, we have created a groundswell of EM momentum and are working around the world to develop innovative solutions to make EM more reliable, functional, and affordable. TNC has created a groundswell of EM momentum. To meet this moment, we need to combine transformative EM technology improvements with innovative market and policy partnerships.  Catalyze development of low-cost, durable EM systems to reduce EM costs and deliver near-real-time information for science, compliance, and labor monitoring purposes. Demonstrate the value of EM through “on the water” pilot projects coupled with sustained market, government, and multilateral engagements.  Advance market engagement strategies that bolster best practices in EM program design and reinforce early EM adoption to drive market transformation across governments and industry. Ensure that policies are adopted by national, regional, and global bodies to advance the implementation of electronic monitoring programs. Today, most EM programs manually remove hard drives from vessels when they return to port, where they are subsequently transported to data centers for human review. This is difficult to coordinate at scale, exorbitantly expensive (data review can account for as much as 60% of annualized program costs) and it is often ineffective given the time delay between the fishing event and the data availability. These factors can degrade the value of EM data and prevent critical interventions that would otherwise protect marine species and keep IUU seafood products out of the seafood supply chain. TNC is leading innovative solutions to address these issues and accelerate the successful adoption of EM globally: 
 
        Develop a tool to facilitate the transfer, storage, governance, and reporting of EM data in one easy-to-use cloud-based platform that can operate across geographies and EM programs.
        
     
 
        Reduce costs and provide near-real-time information to industry and government stakeholders on the legality and sustainability of a vessel’s catch before products enter global supply chains.
        
     TNC is working to develop EM leadership for country government and industry partners across several geographies. These fisheries are selected based on their ability to bear the early transaction costs of scaling EM and test new EM applications. So far, we have supported pilot projects in over 18 different geographies. To build on this work, we are continuing to support on-the-water implementation in new geographies and through new use cases for EM by: Build on foundational work to pilot and inform EM program design and implementation to cultivate buy-in from public- and private-sector actors to commit to EM. TNC has tested and proven that EM can be a critical tool for verifying and monitoring transshipment activities (when an offload of a product or crew member changes from one vessel to another while still out at sea). We will scale this body of work to provide more incentive for fisheries authorities to adopt EM. Develop parameters for how EM can be used as a tool to eliminate human rights abuses at sea. Improving technology and data analytics is imperative for EM to operate at scale, but to create transformational change we need to catalyze market leadership. TNC has secured partnerships with all major US tuna brand suppliers, with participation from major retailers like Walmart. Increasing market commitments has the potential to incentivize political reform and create economic advantages for early market adopters, especially as consumers are made more aware of these unsustainable fishing practices and their ecological and socio-economic impacts. TNC is accelerating market leadership from major global seafood suppliers and retailers by:         1. Driving 100% monitoring commitments from key seafood stakeholders.         2. Deepening market engagement across the supply chain.  TNC is no stranger to this work and is seeking to find and utilize innovative strategies for accelerating this work. TNC is now adapting Pacific Island Tuna, a joint venture between TNC and the Republic of the Marshall Islands that is disrupting the $50 billion/year global tuna market to align supply chain incentives around delivering legal, sustainable seafood products to market that enhance supply chain resilience. We have learned firsthand that getting the policy details right matters. In partnership with fisheries management authorities and multilateral institutions, TNC is prioritizing engagement at all levels to drive the adoption of streamlined policies that catalyze EM uptake and ensure EM programs deliver tangible conservation outcomes. We will do this by providing technical support to countries and regional bodies on the development of fisheries transparency laws and regulations and by demonstrating EM’s ability to fill data gaps to understand the health of target fish stocks and the fisheries’ impact on endangered and threatened species. TNC will drive coordination and collaboration to advance EM policy uptake by:   
 
        We will engage with our government partners, new and old, to advance EM program design and implementation that can help countries reach their commitment objectives.
        
     
 
        To enable greater EM policy uptake, TNC is creating a policy toolkit that provides targeted technical EM support and guidance.
        
     
 
        These workshops will foster an informal network where leading EM geographies can learn from one another, reinforce local policy gains, and highlight areas of collaboration for international policy development in key seafood-supplying nations.
        
     TNC is engaging in more than 25 countries and has supported over 10 EM pilot projects. This work has fostered major EM interest and commitments across several of these geographies including 100% electronic monitoring commitments in: Chile, Federated States of Micronesia, Ghana, New Zealand, Palau, and Seychelles.

Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Google,Inaccurate EU catch reporting…," Legalising misreporting of catches will threaten fisheries and undermine the EU’s credibility when pushing for sustainable fishing worldwide, write Steve Trent and Stella Nemecky. Steve Trent is CEO of the Environmental Justice Foundation; Stella Nemecky is Senior Policy Advisor EU Fisheries of WWF Deutschland Fisheries cannot be managed sustainably without good catch data. It is impossible to set effective quotas and assess the health of fish populations if the catches are unknown or inaccurate. This essential principle should be immediately evident. Yet the European Parliament has recently supported a move to extend the ‘margin of tolerance’ for inaccuracies in reporting to the point where up to 40% of catches – and up to 50% in the case of tuna – might be omitted from official records without any penalty. This means millions of tonnes of fish could go uncounted – potentially the difference between thriving populations and a precipitous collapse of stocks.  One proposal under scrutiny suggests raising the margin of tolerance to 20% from the current 10%. Yet we know that 10% can already be fraudulently doubled by vessel owners – there is no reason why the same couldn’t be done with a higher margin, making 20% into 40%. Here’s how it can be done. On most vessels, fishers can accurately estimate their catches before landing. With 5500 tonnes of fish on board, a captain enters 5000 in the log. Any check would show it is safely within the 10% margin. However, very few landings are physically checked by the authorities and weighing is often carried out by the industry itself. If the weight is then recorded as 4500 tonnes, it still falls within 10% of what is in the logbook, the numbers add up on paper, warranting no further investigation. Yet the vessel has landed an extra thousand tonnes of fish which was not removed from its quota. And the opportunities for misreporting do not end there. Last year, after extensive lobbying from industry, notably French and Spanish tuna fleets fishing in the Indian Ocean, the Council of the EU proposed a change to the legislation that would mean that species deemed ‘morphologically similar’ can be legally reported completely interchangeably, as long as the total weight adds up. In other words, a catch of two similar-looking but completely separate species, such as juvenile yellowfin tuna (currently overfished in the Indian Ocean) and bigeye tuna, might be reported, with no penalty, as 30% yellowfin, 70% bigeye when the true proportions were 70% yellowfin and 30% bigeye.  The wild inaccuracy these changes would cause in reporting would make a mockery of any pretence that the EU manages fish populations on a scientific basis. Fish stocks cannot be managed sustainably if catches might be 40-50% higher than estimated, or if species might have been misidentified and recorded as an entirely different species. As Grace O’Sullivan, MEP and Greens’ negotiator, says: “The EU Common Fisheries Policy is founded on science and the precautionary approach – but a gaping loophole like this will not only put the future of the fisheries industry and marine ecosystems at risk, it will also threaten the success of the European Green Deal and undermine the EU’s work in collaborating with other countries to improve global fisheries sustainability.” She’s right. How can the EU continue to demand that other countries eradicate any illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing when Europe’s own vessels are not required to report their catches with any degree of accuracy, and management is based on data so shaky it represents nothing but a black hole of uncertainty? There can be little doubt about the damaging effects of these proposals that undermine science, erode effective management, and serve only short-termism and quick profits at the cost of genuinely sustainable fisheries.  These proposals are still under consideration as the EU Fisheries Control Regulation undergoes negotiations, and they have not gone unopposed. The European Commission itself is against these changes to the margin of tolerance, with Commissioner for Fisheries Virginijus Sinkevičius stating that accurate catch reporting is a fundamental principle of the Common Fisheries Policy. Some member states, too, have shown that they may fight this. Finland has already voted against the Council’s proposal for expanding interchangeable reporting of species and Germany’s new coalition agreement states that it will demand fair, science-based catch quotas. To remain true to that, the German government must lead the opposition to these proposals. The truth is that under these changes up to four in ten fish may go missing from the records, torpedoing any chance of sustainable, science-based management and threatening livelihoods and marine life both in Europe and across the globe. The EU and member states must not give in to aggressive lobbying from industry bodies who use ‘technical difficulties’ in reporting as a smokescreen for squeezing damaging short-term profits from our ocean. As Commissioner Sinkevičius put it: “If we managed to send men to the moon in the 1960s, we can certainly estimate catches within 10% accuracy in 2021.”This story was originally published by EURACTIV and is reposted here with permission.

Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Google,The state of world fisheries and aquaculture Part 1,"   Despite fluctuations in supply and demand, caused by the changing state of fisheries resources, the economic climate and environmental conditions, fisheries and aquaculture remain very important as a source of food, employment and revenue in many countries and communities. Reported global capture fisheries and aquaculture production contracted from a figure of 122 million tonnes in 1997 to 117 million tonnes in 1998. This was mainly owing to the effects of the climate anomaly, El Niño, on some major marine capture fisheries (Figure 1, p. 4 and Table 1). However, production recovered in 1999, for which the preliminary estimate is about 125 million tonnes. The production increase of 20 million tonnes over the last decade was mainly due to aquaculture, as capture fisheries production remained relatively stable. For the two decades following 1950, world marine and inland capture fisheries production increased on average by as much as 6 percent per year, trebling from 18 million tonnes in 1950 to 56 million tonnes in 1969. During the 1970s and 1980s, the average rate of increase declined to 2 percent per year, falling to almost zero in the 1990s. This levelling off of the total catch follows the general trend of most of the world's fishing areas, which have apparently reached their maximum potential for capture fisheries production, with the majority of stocks being fully exploited. It is therefore very unlikely that substantial increases in total catch will be obtained. In contrast, growth in aquaculture production has shown the opposite tendency. Starting from an insignificant total production, inland and marine aquaculture production grew by about 5 percent per year between 1950 and 1969 and by about 8 percent per year during the 1970s and 1980s, and it has increased further to 10 percent per year since 1990. The global patterns of fish production owe much to the activities of China, which reports production in weight that accounts for 32 percent of the world total. Other major producer countries are Japan, India, the United States, the Russian Federation and Indonesia.  When China is excluded, however, the production of fish used as food for humans has remained relatively stable (Figure 2), but the production of fish destined for animal feed has decreased in recent years - the decline registered in 1998 was largely due to the El Niño effect, particularly on the anchoveta fishery which supplies a significant proportion of the fish used for fishmeal and fish oil. However, the event had much less impact on the supply of fish for food, which declined only slightly to 11.8 kg per capita. Outside China, the world's population has been increasing more quickly than total fish production and the per capita fish supply has declined since the 
mid-1980s. In contrast, China has reported increases in fish production and shows little sign of slowing growth (Figure 3). Most of the production is used domestically and for human consumption, but there has also been a recent expansion in the production of feed. There has been a major growth of aquaculture, which now dominates China's production, although capture fisheries have also seen increases. Per capita fish supply, based on reported production, has increased dramatically over the last 20 years, indicating the growing importance of fish as food. This increased supply has been helped by China's slowing population growth.     Employment in the primary capture fisheries and aquaculture production sectors in 1998 is estimated to have been about 36 million people, comprising about 15 million full-time, 13 million part-time and 8 million occasional workers. For the first time, there is an indication that growth in employment in the primary sectors of fisheries and aquaculture has ceased (Figure 4). Employment in inland and marine aquaculture has been increasing, and is now estimated to account for about 25 percent of the total. Marine capture fisheries account for about 60 percent and inland capture fisheries for the remaining 15 percent. International trade in fishery commodities fell back from a peak of US$53.5 billion dollars (f.o.b.) in 1997 to US$51.3 billion in 1998. This is probably the result of a combination of factors, including a recession in East Asia which weakened demand, particularly in Japan, and lower fishmeal production and trade resulting from decreased catches of anchoveta. Preliminary 1999 data indicate a 4 percent growth in the value of world fishery trade (US$53.4 billion). However, there are no indications of increased capture fisheries production in the long term, so any long-term rise in the value of exports is likely to depend on increased aquaculture production or product prices. Developing countries registered a net fishery trade surplus of US$16.8 billion, slightly down from the 1997 level of US$17.3 billion. Total capture fisheries production in 1998 amounted to 86 million tonnes, a noticeable decline from the maximum of about 93 million tonnes recorded in 1996 and 1997, although there was a considerable recovery to an estimated 92 million tonnes in 1999. In 1998, China, Japan, the United States, the Russian Federation, Peru, Indonesia, Chile and India (in that order) were the top producing countries, together accounting for more than half of total capture fisheries production by weight for 1998 (Figure 5). Although in decline, marine capture fisheries continue to account for more than 90 percent of world capture fisheries production. The remainder comes from inland water fisheries, which have increased their output by almost 0.5 million tonnes per year since 1994. World marine capture fisheries production dropped to 78 million tonnes in 1998 (Table 1), representing a 9 percent decline with respect to the all-time production highs of about 86 million tonnes in 1996 and 1997. The decline appears to have been caused essentially by climatic conditions. However, it does not affect the previously reported slowdown in the rate of increase of marine catches for the last decade. The estimated first sale value of the landings also decreased, from about US$81 billion in 1996 and 1997 to US$76 billion in 1998.

Most of the decline in the world's marine fisheries landings in 1998 can be attributed to changes in the Southeast Pacific, which was severely affected by the El Niño event in 1997-1998. Total capture fisheries production from this area dropped from 17.1 million tonnes in 1996 to 14.4 million tonnes in 1997, decreasing even more dramatically to 8 million tonnes in 1998. These figures represent annual declines of 15 and 44 percent, respectively, occurring over two consecutive years in one of the most important fishing areas of the world. Apart from the Southeast Atlantic, the Southwest Pacific and the Western Central Pacific, which have shown positive trends in catches in recent years, all of the world's major fishing areas showed minor changes or declines in landings.  The Northwest Pacific had the largest reported landings in 1998, followed by the Northeast Atlantic and the Western Central Pacific (Figure 6). Typically, high landings are dependent on one or two productive stocks, such as Alaska pollock and Japanese anchovy in the Northwest Pacific, Atlantic herring in the Northeast Atlantic and skipjack and yellowfin tunas in the Western Central Pacific. The dependence of some areas on the production of a few species is illustrated by the low ranking of the Southeast Pacific, which was the result of the 1998 El Niño event. This area would usually rank second after the Northwest Pacific.  Alaska pollock from the North Pacific had the highest landings in 1998 (Figure 7a). This, too, is unusual, as anchoveta landings generally exceed this quantity and those of Chilean jack mackerel equal it. However, the fisheries for both these species were severely affected in 1998. Alaska pollock catches have fallen by 0.5 million tonnes since 1996, continuing a general decline in production since the mid-1980s, when landings exceeded 6 million tonnes. The Western Central Pacific shows an overall trend of increasing production, with no evidence of levelling off in the near future. This overall trend depends not only on the major tuna stocks but also on very wide categories of marine fish, which makes it difficult to assess the underlying trends of different species and stocks. In contrast to these two regions, production in the Northeast Atlantic has remained stable at around 11 million tonnes since the mid-1970s (Figure 7b), although the biomass of cod stocks is currently at a very low level.  It is worth noting that production from the Northwest Pacific has shown a constant overall increase since 1950. However, since 1992, this has continued only because China's reported increases in production have more than made up for combined declines of 
all the other countries in the area (Figure 8). Major fluctuations have been recorded for some individual species over the last three years. Of particular relevance are the increases in landings between 1997 and 1998 for some of the 30 highest-producing species, such as Patagonian grenadiers (up by 285 percent), blue whiting (up by 67 percent), Japanese Spanish mackerel (up by 51 percent), South American pilchard (up by 30 percent) and Japanese anchovy (up by 26 percent). However, overall, the increases in production of some species have been outweighed by the production declines for others, particularly those of major high-producing species, such as anchoveta (down by 78 percent), Chilean jack mackerel (down by 44 percent), capelin (down by 38 percent), Japanese flying squid (down by 37 percent), Argentine shortfin squid (down by 33 percent), Atlantic horse mackerel (down by 22 percent) and chub mackerel (down by 21 percent).   In 1998, production from inland capture fisheries was 8 milion tonnes, which represents a 6 
percent increase over 1997 levels. The top ten countries with regard to inland fisheries production are listed 
in Table 2. These countries account for 65 percent of the world's total inland catch. More than 90 percent of this 
production in 1998 came from developing countries, and only 3.5 percent from industrial countries.  Country Production in 1998

Some 46 percent of the catch comprises freshwater fish that are not identified by species, while unidentified crustaceans and molluscs contribute 7.6 and 
7 percent, respectively, to production. Overall, 80 percent of the catch in inland waters is not identified by species.  Although the situation regarding some of the highest-producing stocks has worsened, global exploitation of the main marine fish stocks for which assessment information is available continues to follow the general trend observed in previous years. Overall, the number of underexploited and moderately exploited fisheries resources continues to decline slightly and, as fishing pressure increases, 
the number of fully exploited stocks remains relatively stable while the number of overexploited, depleted and recovering 
stocks is increasing slightly.  Among the major marine fish stocks or groups of stocks for which information is available, an estimated 25 to 27 percent are underexploited or moderately exploited and thus represent the main potential source for expansion of total capture fisheries production. About 47 to 50 percent of stocks are fully exploited and are, therefore, producing catches that have either reached or are very close to their maximum limits, with no room expected for further expansion. Another 15 to 18 percent are overexploited and have no potential for further increase. Moreover, there is an increasing likelihood that catches from these stocks will decrease if remedial action is not taken to reduce or revert overfishing conditions. Only then will sustained higher catches be possible. The remaining 9 to 10 percent of stocks have been depleted or are recovering from depletion. As they are less productive than usual, depleted and recovering stocks tend to have ample potential for recuperation that is commensurate with their pre-depletion catch levels. Realizing this potential, however, can be a major undertaking and usually implies the adoption of drastic management measures in order to revert uncontrolled and excessive fishing pressure as well as any other condition that could have contributed to the stock's overexploitation or depletion. Total catches from the Northwest and the Southeast Atlantic are levelling off after reaching their maximum levels a decade or two ago. In the Eastern Central Atlantic and the Northwest Pacific, total catches are increasing again, after a short decline following their maximum production levels of a decade ago. Most of these changes result from increases in landings of small pelagics. In the Northeast Atlantic, the Western Central Atlantic, the Northeast Pacific, the Mediterranean and Black Sea, the Eastern Central Pacific and the Southwest Pacific, annual catches have stabilized or are declining slightly, having reached their maximum potentials a few years ago. In the Southwest Atlantic and the Southeast Pacific, total annual catches have declined sharply only a few years after reaching their all-time highs. These two areas have been seriously affected by the decline, and in some cases the serious depletion, of important stocks. Among such stocks are Argentine shortfin squid and Argentine hake in the Southwest Atlantic and anchoveta and horse mackerel in the Southeast Pacific.  The areas where total catches are still tending to grow, and where - at least in principle - there is the highest potential for production increases, are the Eastern and Western Indian Ocean and the Western Central Pacific. These areas tend to have a lower incidence of fully exploited, overexploited, depleted or recovering fish stocks, and a prevalence of underexploited or moderately exploited stocks, although they also have the highest incidence of stocks whose state of exploitation is unknown or uncertain and for which overall production estimates are consequently less reliable. Inland aquatic resources continue to be under pressure from loss or degradation of habitat and overfishing. Freshwater species are reported to be the most threatened group of vertebrates harvested by humans; however, accurate data are difficult to collect. In areas where studies have been carried out, about 20 percent of freshwater species are threatened, endangered or extinct.
1 Inland fisheries statistics reflect the poor state of information on many inland fisheries resources; only three of the top ten taxa in terms of production are identified by species, and these three account for less than 8 percent of total production. As has already been noted,2 in many areas, the actual yield from inland fisheries may be several times higher than reported, but work is under way to correct this situation. The Mekong River Commission has revised its unofficial estimates of fisheries production from the Mekong basin, increasing them from approximately 300 000 to 1.2 million tonnes by including family and small-scale fishers whose catches were previously not counted. It is extremely difficult to assess the state of inland fisheries resources when reporting does not include all the sectors of the fishery and when the catch is not broken down by species. In addition to the concerns expressed about individual stocks, there is increasing interest in ecosystems and the impact that fishing may be having on their structure and function. There is a shortage of general information on the relationship between the state of marine ecosystems and fishing. Broad indicators of change are available from data on capture fisheries production in the major fishing areas but it is usually difficult to separate changes in exploitation patterns from changes in the underlying ecosystem. The trend has been for the variety of resources being exploited to increase, probably reflecting the reaching of production limits for major stocks and an expansion of markets for a wider range of fishery products. Indicators regarding the ecologies in which fisheries can develop suggest that the ecosystems in most areas are close to full exploitation. The Eastern Indian Ocean and the Western Central Pacific are the only areas showing little sign of stress, and hence the potential for continued development of resources.  The Northeast Atlantic has followed a trend of declining catches together with a shift towards landings of fish from lower levels in the food web, which may indicate an underlying ecological change (see Monitoring the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems, 
Part 2). The indices that were developed to monitor such change suggest that ecosystems may be shifting away from the unexploited state, giving cause for concern that continued heavy fishing may lead to more widespread changes. Rivers, lakes and wetlands account for less than 1 percent of the global surface area, but yield at least 8 percent of global fisheries production. However, these productive ecosystems are under pressure from the needs of a growing human population. The World Resources Institute (WRI)3 reported that half of the world's wetlands were lost in the last century and that dams, diversions and canals fragment almost 60 percent of the world's largest rivers. Per capita water consumption increased by 50 percent between 1950 and 1990, and human use of available water resources is expected to increase from its current level of about 54 percent to more than 70 percent by 2025.4 Although inland water ecosystems have improved in some areas of North America and Europe, their condition is continuing to deteriorate in much of the world. Since the last issue of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (1998), 1 124 fishing vessels have been added to Lloyd's database of vessels over 100 tons,5 548 of which were built in the period 1997-1999. The remainder were built earlier and their inclusion in the database represents an improvement in its coverage rather than a real increase in the fleet. The trends are similar to those identified in 1998, with decreased numbers of vessels in developed countries' fishing fleets and increased numbers in some developing countries. Late reporting is still a problem so, although the data should refer to 1998 and 1999, it is more practical to consider the period as mid-1997 to mid-1999. There were 955 deletions from the database, but this is probably an underestimate as some of the vessels scrapped were of unknown flag. The estimated decrease in the fleet (i.e. the vessels removed from the database minus the vessels built in 1998-1999) is 407 vessels, giving a total of 23 014 vessels at the end of 1999.  The United States shows an increase of roughly 10 percent, mainly because about 300 vessels that should have been in the 1997 and earlier databases were added in 1998-1999. In fact, the United States fleet really decreased by 26 vessels. Belize showed an increase in flagged fishing vessels from 158 to 427. New vessels and flagging in from other countries contributed to this increase. The Panama fleet decreased from its maximum of 574 vessels in 1994 to 226 in 1999. The recent decrease followed efforts by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) to control the activities of the high seas tuna fleet. The Philippines increased its fleet from 367 to 436 (16 percent) by building new vessels and flagging in. The Cuba fleet decreased from 113 to 49 through the scrapping of a fleet of vessels built mainly in the 1960s.  Some countries prepared fishing capacity reduction plans according to the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity. The database records 548 new vessels built in the two-year period since the previous study reported in The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 1998, including 171 vessels built in 1997 but reported late, 243 in 1998 and 134 in 1999 (this will probably increase owing to late reporting). Five countries made up 58 percent of this total: the United States (75 vessels), Belize (47), Spain (99), Norway (43) and Japan (56). The other countries of the European Community (EC) account for a further 82 vessels, bringing their contribution up to 73 percent of the total. The significant number of new vessels built under the Belize flag means that 15 percent of the total new buildings are recorded in open registers. Despite the number of vessels built during the two-year period, the United States, Japan and Spain achieved reductions in their national fleets by scrapping and flagging out. The decrease in building since the early 1990s is significant, not only in terms of numbers, but also in terms of average and aggregate tonnage. In the period 1991-1993, 
2 126 vessels were built, with an aggregate tonnage of 990 000 tons. In the period 1997-1999, 1 127 fishing vessels were built with an aggregate tonnage of 418 000 tons. The average tonnage dropped from 465 to 370 tons, although this decrease is highly likely to be an underestimate because there was also a change in the unit of measurement during this period from gross registered tonnage (GRT) to gross tonnage (GT). Some 955 vessels were removed from the database in the two-year period, i.e. fewer than were predicted in The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 1998. However, there has been a substantial increase in the number of vessels changing their flags to ""unknown""; from six in 1994, to 694 in 1997 and 931 in 1999. The average age of these vessels is 27 years, so it is likely that most are intended to be scrapped. Nevertheless, the share of vessels over 40 years of age is slightly more than 1 percent of the total. The average age of vessels scrapped or lost was 30.6 years compared with 27.3 two years ago, and the average age of the fleet was 21.3 years, against 22.1 years two years ago. The average age decreased because, although very few new vessels were built, some very old vessels were removed from the fleet.  During the two-year period, 1 216 vessels were reflagged. The most significant reflagging was to the Belize flag (182), which also acquired a large number of new vessels (47). The number of fishing vessels under the Belize flag increased from 211 to 427. Honduras, St Vincent, Vanuatu and Cyprus slightly increased the numbers of vessels registered in their open registers. On the other hand, following ICCAT measures for improved flag state responsibility, Panama showed a significant decrease, from 321 to 226 vessels. Registration and reflagging of fishing vessels are described in Box 1. To avoid duplication in administration, it is common practice for most states to include large fishing vessels on their shipping registers as a separate class of vessel. It is less important for states to include smaller vessels that fish within their national jurisdiction on the register, although many have made registration compulsory.  Increasingly, shipping and fishing regulations require vessels to carry national certificates of registry, particularly on the high seas and in waters under the jurisdiction of another state. This requirement is summarized as follows in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, Part VII, High Seas: Article 91Nationality of ships 1. Every State shall fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality to ships, for the registration of ships in its territory, and for the right to fly its flag. Ships have the nationality of the State whose flag they are entitled to fly. There must exist a genuine link between the State and the ship.
2. Every State shall issue to ships which it has granted the right to fly its flag documents to that effect. The international standards for the registration of ships have been codified in the UN Convention on the Conditions for the Registration of Ships (1986). Although this Convention is not yet in force and exempts fishing vessels, it clearly describes the procedures to be followed in order to avoid any misuse or fraudulent practice associated with registration. For instance, it describes the procedures to be followed in bare-boat chartering when the vessel is subject to dual registry.  The issue of ""open registers"" stems from the stipulation quoted above: ""There must exist a genuine link between the State and the ship"". While many states have implemented regulations and requirements to establish such a genuine link for registration, there have been no agreed international criteria for what constitutes a ""genuine link"". Regulations usually establish linkages through nationality of ownership and/or of the crew. It then becomes a question of the degree of linkage, described in vaguely defined terms - in decreasing degree of linkage - as ""genuine national registers"", ""offshore registers"", ""open registers"" and ""flag of convenience registers"".  Owners choose to register their fishing vessels under foreign flags for a variety of reasons. Similar patterns of registration in the trading and fishing fleets would suggest that a major reason for registering under a particular flag may be to avoid taxation. Some countries with open registers are also well-known offshore tax havens. However, increasingly, the reflagging of fishing vessels in particular fisheries has been directly associated with the avoidance of fisheries management measures, and the share of large fishing vessels registered in open registers has increased to around 6 percent of the global total. Source: A. Smith, FAO Fisheries Department. Fishing technologies evolve in response to a wide variety of factors. Demand-driven developments are particularly important. Another, and probably even more prominent factor, is development resulting from general technical innovations in disciplines that are not always directly related to fisheries. The following recent developments will probably have a significant impact on fisheries in the future. The impact of fishing on the environment is a global issue of growing concern. Various gears and fishing methods have attracted attention for their potential impact on the environment. Concerns are mostly related to gear selectivity and habitat damage, the major issues being: Much has been done recently to address such problems, and gear and techniques are being modified to reduce the possible impacts. The selective performance of trawl gear is being improved continuously and selective grids have, to a large extent, eliminated the by-catch of fish in the northern shrimp fisheries. Selective grids and square meshes are used in several trawl fisheries to reduce the capture of small-sized individuals. Technologies that depend on behaviour differences between shrimp and fish are increasingly being introduced in tropical shrimp fisheries, resulting in reduced fish 
by-catches. Another prevailing tendency in tropical shrimp fisheries is an increase in landings of fish by-catches.  The impact of trawling on the bottom habitat is being investigated in many countries. Except for the obvious damage caused to coral reefs by large trawlers, for example in some areas off the coast of Norway, little is known about the long-term effects. In 1999, Norway introduced non-trawling areas where the risk of damage to deep-water coral reefs was high. One widespread practice is to encircle drifting objects - fish attraction devices (FADs) - with purse seines when fishing for tuna. FADs often attract many small fish, and the capture of small tunas and other fish species around FADs are now considered a major problem in some purse seine fisheries. No way of mitigating this problem has yet been found, apart from reducing the use of such practices. One possible solution now being investigated is to insert selective devices made from panels of larger meshes or sorting grids into the purse seine. A number of measures can be adopted to reduce the incidental catch of seabirds by longlines, including attaching extra weight to the line while setting; setting during darkness; and the use of scaring devices when setting longline gear. Such mitigation techniques are being introduced in several longline fisheries, either as part of national regulations or through voluntary adoption by fishers who recognize the benefits of not having bait stolen from their hooks by seabirds. The International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries adopted by FAO's members in 1999 will most likely accelerate the implementation of measures to reduce seabird by-catch in longline fisheries.  Since the introduction of such synthetic fibres as polyamide, polyester and polypropylene to fishing gear in the 1950s, there were no major introductions of new fibres in fishing gear until the arrival of Dynema fibre - a polyethylene of ultra-high molecular weight. The fishing industry now has a material that might have a significant impact on the catching performance of fishing gear. The basic property of Dynema fibre is that it has a density of slightly less than 1, which makes it float in water. Its tensile strength on a diameter basis exceeds that of steel by 50 to 100 percent and that of polyamide (nylon) by 300 to 400 percent. Another feature of Dynema is its low elongation compared with other synthetic fibres, which makes it nearly as inelastic as steel. At present, the fibre is relatively expensive and its application is therefore limited. However, there are several signs of increased use, particularly in pelagic trawls, where thinner twine results in reduced towing resistance and can therefore be used to save fuel (by using a similar-sized trawl) or, when the trawl size is increased, improves the catching efficiency of the vessel compared with others of its size. This latter feature is used to develop viable trawl fisheries on scattered fish concentrations, which require large trawl mouth areas. Other fisheries for which the fibre might make profitable improvements are those aimed at smaller individuals, such as small crustaceans and mesopelagic fish, which require large volumes of water to be filtered. The towing of two or more trawls simultaneously was, until recently, only practised by outrigger shrimp trawlers. Thousands of such trawlers fish penaeid shrimps in tropical waters. Towards the end of the 1990s, multirig trawling was successfully introduced into fisheries of such species as nephrops, deepwater shrimp and, to some extent, flatfishes. Particularly in Iceland and Norway, large trawlers equipped for towing two trawls have been built for harvesting deepwater shrimp. The catching efficiency of vessels using multirig trawls increases by 50 to 100 percent, clearly indicating an expanded capacity to exploit shrimp resources. Multirig trawling is now widely used in the North Sea nephrops fishery and is increasingly replacing single-otter trawling. An important innovation that facilitates the operation of twin trawls is the symmetry sensor, which monitors the two trawls during towing.  In the last few years, the introduction of satellite communications, which are replacing medium-frequency radios, has had a great impact on skippers' ability to manage all aspects of the fishing operation. The new equipment is controlled by microprocessors, including an inbuilt global positioning system (GPS) module. Some of the better known applications of satellite communications equipment include the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS) or the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS). When the GMDSS is activated, a distress message is sent by pushing a button. An electronic message, which includes the identity of the vessel and its position, is sent to all other vessels and radio stations in the immediate area. The crew of the vessel can then concentrate on the emergency, secure in the knowledge that the distress message will be effective. The message activates alarms on the other vessels and allows them to go straight to the emergency without having to search for it.  VMS is used by fisheries management authorities to observe the positions of vessels. At predetermined intervals, the satellite communications system automatically sends a message, containing the identity and position of each vessel to the fisheries monitoring centre. The sequence of positions of an individual vessel can be stored and subsequently displayed on a monitor, to give an indication of that vessel's activities. If the vessel is considered to be acting suspiciously, a patrol craft can be sent directly to investigate further.  VMS is playing an increasingly important role in monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS), and it makes such activities more cost-effective. The EC's implementation of the VMS scheme for most of its fishing vessels over 
24 m will bring the total number of vessels reporting their identity and position to 
fisheries management authorities 
using VMS technology to around 8 000 worldwide. Satellite surveillance of fishing vessels is becoming a tool for MCS. Longline vessels are particularly easy to locate by microwave sensors because they carry radar reflectors on their buoys. The complementary information from VMS and satellite surveillance will make it possible to locate non-compliant vessels, which are more likely to be involved in illegal fishing. Satellite surveillance could be implemented far more quickly than VMS has been because it is completely independent of the vessel and does not rely on cooperation. The integration of three separate modules of equipment into one unit (i.e. computer, GPS and a satellite communications system) is expected to increase efficiency. Electronic fishing logbooks are being tested, and will make it possible to send information, at predetermined intervals or on demand, through a satellite link to the fisheries management authorities. The information can also be sent to fish markets, resulting in a quicker, more efficient sales process and a better quality of product because of minimal handling. Even fish stock assessment and fisheries management will benefit from the almost real-time reporting of fish catches and more detailed information on where the fish are caught. One fishery in Australia is already being managed by these means. Attaching video cameras with a wide enough band to the satellite communications systems allows the transmission of video images. This could be used to assist in treating injured or sick personnel on fishing vessels. The repair of equipment such as engines, winches or electronic equipment, which normally requires the intervention of specialized engineers, can also be undertaken following advice given over the satellite link. This would avoid the costly and time-consuming travel that is currently needed for specialized engineers. The most up-to-date navigation equipment, GPS, now has an accuracy of +/-10 m because the satellite signal is no longer artificially degraded. However, the size of other pieces of equipment and their dependence on microprocessors mean that they can be linked together to become more interactive. Monitors are already being used to provide displays or readouts from multiple pieces of equipment. Monitors can also overlay the information obtained from radar, sonar and navigation equipment.  These developments may lead to some of this new equipment becoming a legal requirement for larger vessels over 300 tons within the next decade. An example is voyage data recorders, which are similar to the flight recorders carried on aircraft. The use of an  automatic identification system (AIS) will also become mandatory in busy sea lanes for this size of fishing vessel. AIS uses automatic interrogation by satellite communication, so that the name, type and size of the ship, along with details of its course and speed, can be displayed on the radar in the traffic control centre. This is potentially useful for fisheries patrol vessels when they are passing through areas with a high density of fishing vessels because it would obviate the necessity of boarding and checking the licences of each fishing vessel. Most countries have similar management objectives, although the emphasis differs between developed and developing nations. Developed countries are usually faced with fully or overexploited stocks, so their management objectives concentrate on stock rebuilding and capacity reduction, although most countries also have significant aims regarding markets and social conflict. The most urgent objective is to scale fleet sizes so that they become commensurate with sustainable exploitation of the resources. Management plans also increasingly recognize the need for a policy that integrates fisheries with management of the coastal zone or inland waters. In contrast, developing countries tend to concentrate on fisheries development in terms of new resources and technology. Although it is recognized that some stocks are overfished, objectives are concentrated more on enhancing and diversifying fisheries rather than on limiting fishing efforts. This is perhaps because the underlying concern for many countries is the relatively important role fisheries play in employment and food security for some of their poorest people. More specific aims include building infrastructure (particularly for processing to reduce post-harvest losses and increase the value added); fishery enhancement, through restocking; and reducing social conflicts, not only among different fishing groups but also between fisheries and other sectors. Fisheries management is widely considered to be ineffective because of the poor state of many important fish stocks. However, in many respects, management has improved a great deal over recent years. Policies and objectives appear more realistic, concentrating more on management and less on development, and making the best social use of resources. Explicit recognition of risk and consideration of longer-term production, for example in the adoption of the precautionary approach (see Indicators of sustainable development and the precautionary approach in marine capture fisheries, Part 2), are increasingly reflected in decision-making, and there has been growing recognition of the need to protect the ecosystem as well as individual stocks, through measures that include the provision of marine reserves. Technical innovations for improving management advice have been developed rapidly, but implementation has been slow because of the short-term economic and political consequences. As a result, the rate of real change in management has been slow, and it is debatable whether improvements have kept pace with the increasing pressures on resources. Nevertheless, there are situations where management has improved and clear benefits are apparent. Some countries have reported the successful implementation of property rights schemes for fisheries. It is becoming increasingly clear that effective fisheries management, at both the policy-making and the implementation 
stages, depends critically on consensus 
and participation that utilize objective 
and reliable reporting of fishery status and trends (see Box 2).  Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture require informed decisions and actions at all levels, from policy-makers to individual fishers, as well as environmentalists - who are increasingly concerned about fisheries - consumers and the public. Decision-making based on the best scientific evidence requires reliable, relevant and timely information. There are growing demands for objective, unbiased, peer-reviewed and transparent information on the status and trends of fisheries and fisheries resources as a basis for policy-making and fisheries management. The driving forces behind such demands include increasing recognition that overfishing is pervasive and effective management often lacking; the widespread adoption of the precautionary approach to fisheries management as embodied in the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement1 and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries; ecolabelling issues; and concerns about rare or endangered species and the environment. Status and trends reporting has become an issue because of the risk of misinformation. A study by the University of Washington2 evaluated the validity of 14 statements commonly made about the state of marine fisheries resources and found that ten of these were unsupportable or questionable, whereas only four were supportable. (Most of the supportable statements and only a few of the unsupportable ones were attributed to FAO.) Irrespective of whether such inaccurate information is generated deliberately to promote a specific cause or inadvertently through ignorance, it can have a major impact on public opinion and policy-making that may not be in the best interests of either sustainable use of fisheries resources or the conservation of aquatic ecosystems.  FAO is addressing this issue by proposing the improvement of fishery status and trends reporting using a multifaceted approach as outlined by the FAO Advisory Committee on Fisheries Research (ACFR). ACFR has proposed that this could be facilitated by an international plan of action on fishery status and trends reporting, which states would adopt through FAO's Committee on Fisheries (COFI). As envisaged, the plan of action would be a voluntary instrument that would specify actions and procedures to be undertaken by states, both individually and through regional fishery bodies or arrangements, and by FAO to improve fishery status and trends reporting. The plan of action could be built around the following principles: Sustainability and security. States would demonstrate their commitment to sustainable development of fisheries resources and fisheries by providing, inter alia, the best information possible on the status and trends of fisheries within their jurisdictions and in other areas in which they participate. Best scientific evidence. States would seek to improve their collection, compilation and dissemination of the best scientific evidence available on the nature and conduct of fisheries, including environmental and socio-economic information, in conformity with the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Participation and cooperation. States would adopt mechanisms for inclusion of all relevant participants in the preparation, analysis and presentation of fisheries information, including fishers, government and NGOs. States would cooperate with other states in developing and maintaining such information either directly or through regional fishery bodies or arrangements, as appropriate. Objectivity and transparency. States would individually, and through regional fishery bodies and FAO, prepare and disseminate fisheries information in an objective manner, taking into account the best scientific evidence available (including uncertainty), the precautionary approach and national and international obligations related to it, and applying quality criteria and quality assurance protocols. The plan of action would be implemented in a transparent manner in conformity with Article 6.13 of the Code. A mechanism to collate and exchange fisheries information, including status and trends reports is under development at FAO, and it could serve as the key vehicle for implementation of the plan of action. FAO is making a major effort to develop a Fisheries Global Information System (FIGIS), which will facilitate the exchange of fisheries information from a wide variety of domains such as fisheries statistics, exploited species, fisheries resources and stocks, the fisheries themselves, fishing methods, fishing fleets, fish processing and food safety, fish marketing and trade, species introductions and fish diseases. The information architecture will be designed so that the complex system can be presented in a simplified way through logical navigation channels. FIGIS will not be just a dissemination system, but also a means for partners to contribute information. The information will be exchanged according to arrangements specified in partnership agreements involving FAO, regional fishery bodies and national centres of excellence, and using agreed protocols. Thus, the main novelty will be the more systematic and transparent assembly and synthesis of information from national to regional and then to global scales, with users having the possibility of accessing a much more comprehensive range of information. Another main focus and beneficiary of this approach will be the synthesis of the global state of marine fisheries resources.  FAO has a major responsibility to support capacity building in developing countries, thereby allowing users to access, utilize and contribute to fisheries information and knowledge systems, including FIGIS. For example, the Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts (ASFA) bibliographic database may be linked to FIGIS, and work is under way to provide low-income food-deficit countries (LIFDCs) with access to ASFA as well as to ensure more input to the database from those countries. Communication between FIGIS and FAO regional information systems, such as those for Mediterranean capture fisheries and aquaculture or a geographic information system (GIS) project for the West African coast, will be given precedence during the early phases of the FIGIS initiative. Likewise, software for the collection and processing of fisheries statistics has been implemented in many developing countries to improve the quality of national statistics and facilitate their exchange at the regional and global levels.  1 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks.

Source: R. Grainger, FAO Fisheries Department. The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries7 is being used as a foundation on which to base fisheries policy and management. Together with the guidelines for its implementation, the Code contains a broad set of principles and methods for developing and managing fisheries and aquaculture. It is widely recognized by governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as setting the aims for sustainable fisheries over the next few decades and as a basis for national legislation as well as industry-supported Codes of Conduct.  Some countries have no officially approved fisheries management policy. While such an approach appears to leave fisheries management with a free licence, the result is often a lack of transparency and effectiveness. The problem arises in both developed and developing countries and leads to management authorities having poor accountability to the fisheries sector and the public. It is being addressed specifically through extensive consultation procedures among stakeholders (e.g. in Australia and New Zealand), and by emphasis on comanagement systems in many countries. Participatory approaches, where fishing communities are involved in the planning, implementation and evaluation of management systems, are widely supported, 
at least in principle.  Total allowable catches (TACs) are probably the most common fisheries management tool, at least for major fisheries and those in the Northern Hemisphere. There is a growing recognition of the need to control capacity, including fleet sizes, in order to protect stocks and improve economic performance. Gear controls are also a common conservation measure and include the prohibition of destructive methods such as fish poisons and dynamite, the introduction of gears that reduce by-catch, such as turtle excluder devices and mesh size restrictions.  There is also concern about gears that have attracted criticism from environmentalists, such as drift nets, longlines and demersal trawls, and such gears are likely to be more selectively used. Many countries have a policy of developing fishery enhancement through restocking heavily fished resources, thereby avoiding the need to rebuild stocks through reductions in fishing. This is done particularly in inland fisheries, where enhancement, rehabilitation of habitat and reduction of pollution are major aims, alongside the reduction of fishing in order to conserve resources.  Fishing capacity control and reduction is a feature of many countries' policies. Approaches include licensing, buy-back schemes or individual transferable quotas (see Property rights and fisheries management, Part 2). Reducing the access of other countries is also seen as a useful method of conserving resources, and is often adopted before controls and limits are imposed on the national effort capacity. Diversifying fisheries by encouraging vessels to exploit underutilized resources where these are available is seen as the best alternative to fleet reduction, even though such resources are very scarce and, without control of the fishing effort, cannot be exploited sustainably.  Conflicts among user groups are resolved through zoning, stock enhancement, public education, better enforcement of legislation and, too rarely, resource allocation and control of access. A common problem is conflict between industrial and artisanal fleets. The artisanal sector is particularly vulnerable as 
it often depends on set gears that are incompatible with towed gears, such as industrial trawls. The solution is often clear - i.e. introduce zones that separate the gears (particularly when stocks do not move) - but enforcement may be difficult. Improved post-harvest processing is seen as a way of developing the fishing industry without increasing harvests. As well as reducing losses through poor handling, improved processing can raise the value added of fish products and establish uses for otherwise discarded catch. Food safety remains important and has become increasingly stringent for exported products; in many cases Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) procedures must be applied by processors. The distribution of marine fish to inland areas, distant from the coast, appears to be a problem for many of the countries that depend on capture fisheries and have poor infrastructure. This is often a reason for developing freshwater aquaculture closer to markets. For low-income food-deficit countries (LIFDCs), food security, employment, poverty alleviation and equitable access to resources are seen as priority concerns. Women and economically disadvantaged groups are identified in many management plans for special consideration in the provision of finance and training. Budget and general resource constraints are seen as a significant problem for management. While there is a general shortage of human and financial resources for fisheries management in developing countries, other countries are concentrating on methods to cover management costs from resource revenue.  Regional cooperation has many other benefits in addition to cost savings. Many fishery policies explicitly concern themselves with the need to harmonize management measures among and even (in the larger ones) within countries. Benefits stem mainly from improved MCS, which is one of the most expensive aspects of management. Regional cooperation can greatly reduce these costs. The sharing of information and technical expertise, as well as the joint management of shared stocks, are also of increasing interest to multilateral cooperation. To support these there is a need to strengthen regional fisheries management organizations and make them more efficient (see Box 3 for examples of activities in regional fishery bodies). Although there has been a general decline in distant-water fishing, some developing countries still rely on long-range fleets, usually from developed countries, to exploit their offshore resources. Because of the need to share information on foreign fleets, regional management is particularly valuable in dealing with fisheries that have a large foreign component.  However, regional bodies improve the cooperation between states even when distant-water fishing is in decline. Regional fisheries management bodies have an important role to play in combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific Oceans have had tuna management bodies for several decades. Discussions leading to the creation of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) started in 1986. The agreement establishing IOTC entered into force with the accession of the tenth member in 1996. This body was established under Article XIV of the FAO Constitution and now has 18 members, including the EC and 17 states. Membership is open to coastal countries of the Indian Ocean as well as non-riparian countries that are fishing for tuna in this ocean. The commission's objective is the optimum utilization of 16 species of tuna and tuna-like fishes in its area of competence, which is defined as the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas. This commission is the first of its kind in FAO, as it has management powers and is funded totally from member party contributions. Initially, tuna catches in this area were half those of the Atlantic or the Eastern Pacific Oceans, but they have increased rapidly and now account for more than a quarter of world tuna landings. The value of the annual catch of 1.2 million tonnes is also very high (estimated to be between 
 US$2 billion and US$3 billion), as there is a large proportion of valuable fish caught by longlines. Another significant fact is that nearly half the catch comes from artisanal fisheries, whereas in the other oceans most of the catch comes from long-range industrialized operations. The technical activities that gave rise to IOTC started in 1982 through the Indo-Pacific Tuna Development and Management Programme (IPTP), which was funded by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and executed by FAO. The programme was entrusted with the collection of statistical data on tuna fisheries and provided participating countries with a forum for research and the discussion of stock status. Scientific support was provided throughout the lifetime of IPTP through a project funded by Japan. As of 1986, member parties provided all the funding for the operation of the programme. The IOTC secretariat has been operational at its headquarters in Seychelles since the beginning of 1998. During this period, staff have been appointed, statistical databases have been constituted, data from tuna fishing countries have been collected and the dissemination of data and information through the Internet and electronic and print media has been organized. The secretariat also provides support in data collection, training and scientific activities to contracting and cooperating parties. The secretariat takes an active role at the international level, cooperating closely with FAO and other regional fishery bodies in such fields as status and trends reporting, the establishment of statistical standards, the exchange of data and information and the international plans of action on seabird by-catch, sharks and fishing capacity. A coordination mechanism has been introduced among tuna management bodies in all the oceans in order to counter the threat posed by illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. The commission meets every year. Advice on technical and scientific matters is provided through a scientific committee and scientific work is undertaken through working parties. To date, working parties have been constituted for statistics and tagging, as well as for tropical, temperate and neritic tunas and billfish. In the short time since its creation, IOTC has already taken decisions on minimum data reporting standards, the confidentiality of data and measures to regulate IUU fishing. It has also created a new status of Cooperating Party, intended to facilitate the accession of countries that might be hesitant to join or might not have the necessary financial resources. It is anticipated that resource management measures will be taken at the next session. Source: D. Ardill, IOTC Secretary. The foundation of NEAFC can be traced back to the period between the First and Second World Wars. In the 1930s, several conferences were held to address the issue of rational exploitation of fish resources, but attempts to organize an international agreement were interrupted by the Second World War. In 1946, the United Kingdom organized an International Conference on Overfishing, which resulted in the establishment of a Permanent Commission. This commission, founded in 1953, was the forerunner of NEAFC. Its first meeting was attended by delegations from 12 contracting parties and dealt mainly with minimum fish size and the use of various fishing gears. In 1955, the commission set up an ad hoc scientific committee to look into the issues under discussion and seek advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).  During its first years of operation, it was apparent that the measures it could establish were insufficient to protect stocks adequately. Between 1954 and 1958 several informal discussions took place to consider new types of international regulation. In 1959, a conference resulted in the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Convention, which entered into force in 1963. NEAFC, which was formed under this convention, succeeded the permanent commission. The new commission was given additional powers and was able to establish stricter conservation and management measures.  NEAFC formed the framework for international cooperation in the area of fisheries regulation beyond national fishing limits. Its main purpose was to recommend measures to maintain the rational exploitation of fish stocks in the convention's area, taking scientific advice from ICES. In 1967, NEAFC established a Scheme of Joint Enforcement that contained rules for mutual inspection and control outside national fishery jurisdictions. Although all decisions regarding judicial processes were the responsibility of the flag state, this scheme was considered a significant achievement. In 1969, the commission recommended a complete ban on salmon fisheries outside national limits. It also agreed to enforce a closed season for the North Sea herring fishery from 1971. In 1975 a recommendation to ban directed industrial fishing for North Sea herring was agreed.  During this period, the commission's powers increased, as it was allowed to set limits for total allowable catches (TACs) and effort limitations, including the allocation of quotas. The first quota recommendation was on North Sea herring in 1974 and, the following year, NEAFC recommended TACs and quota allocations for 
 15 stocks. By the end of 1976, NEAFC was aware that developments taking place after the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) would result in the extension of fishing limits to 200 miles. In 1977, when the coastal states in the North Atlantic declared 200 miles jurisdiction off their coasts, most of the areas of stocks regulated by NEAFC became national zones. The management of joint stocks became a matter of bilateral or multilateral responsibility, instead of NEAFC's responsibility.  An agreement on membership of the organization was reached between NEAFC's contracting parties and the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1980, enabling the EEC to become a signatory. The 1980 meeting resulted 
 in the Convention on Future Multilateral 
 Co-operation in the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries. 
 A new commission was established in 1982.  The duties and obligations of the new commission were similar to those of the former: it should serve as a forum for consultation and the exchange of information on fish stocks and management and it had the power to make recommendations concerning fisheries in international waters in the convention area. However, since most fisheries activities took place inside coastal state jurisdiction, NEAFC lacked any real responsibility for managing them.  The development of the legal framework for fisheries management following UNCLOS, in particular the Rio Declaration and the United Nations Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, resulted in a new dawn for NEAFC. The commission decided to consider the future of NEAFC in the light of recent developments in the legal framework for fishing in waters outside national jurisdiction. Recent years have seen increased fishing activity and NEAFC has become responsible for managing several stocks in the convention area. In 1998, the current contracting parties - Denmark (in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland), the EC, Iceland, Norway, Poland and the Russian Federation - agreed to strengthen NEAFC by establishing an independent secretariat in London. An agreement was reached on a new Scheme on Control and Enforcement to be applied to waters outside national jurisdiction. This permits the mutual inspection of contracting parties' vessels. Contracting parties are also required to notify the secretariat of vessels authorized to fish in international waters and report the catches taken. Contracting parties have agreed that, as from 
 1 January 2000, they require the satellite tracking of vessels fishing outside national jurisdiction in the Northeast Atlantic. The secretariat will supply up-to-date information about ongoing fishing activities to contracting parties with an inspection presence in the area. NEAFC's contracting parties have also agreed measures to be taken when dealing with non-contracting parties fishing in the area; for example, if fishing of NEAFC-regulated stocks takes place contrary to NEAFC recommendations, non-contracting parties may face prohibition of the landing of catches.

data collection difficult: the diverse and 
diffuse nature of the fisheries; incomplete 
or inaccurate reporting; and 
competition for water resources from other sectors such as agriculture and energy production. In efforts to rebuild fisheries or to add value to the catch of certain water bodies, stocking (often of exotic species) and other enhancement measures have been adopted. Aquaculture can also be an enhancement measure, but in many rural areas aquaculture production accounts for only a small fraction of inland fisheries production and should not be seen as a substitute for fisheries management. Access to fishing areas is often controlled by powerful individuals within the community. As recreational fisheries become an increasingly valuable source of revenue in developing countries (e.g. through access charges and tourism), local subsistence and commercial fishers are losing access to many water bodies. This poses a problem for the management of individual fisheries, so there is a move to manage watersheds and 
habitats instead. Protecting the habitat in watersheds and developing access and ownership schemes for inland water 
bodies are two measures that could help promote responsible inland fisheries, even when there is no accurate information on species catch. Most aquaculture has developed in freshwater environments (Figure 9), and mainly in Asia. The development of inland aquaculture is 
seen as an important source of food security 
in Asia, particularly in land-locked countries.   Freshwater aquaculture production is dominated by finfish, particularly silver, grass and other carps (Figures 10 and 11). Brackish water aquaculture has most frequently been developed for shrimp production, notably the giant tiger prawn, which accounts for the growth in shrimp export markets. Milkfish production dominated brackish water finfish aquaculture in the 1980s, but has subsequently grown more slowly. In volume terms, mariculture has been dominated by seaweeds, notably Japanese kelp, and molluscs, mainly the Pacific cupped oyster. However, as production figures are given in live weight (including the high water content of seaweeds and the heavy shells of molluscs), the statistics give the impression that these products are greater sources of food and employment than they actually are.  Brackish and saltwater aquaculture has seen a growth in high-value salmon in particular, and in brackish water, shrimp is the major high-value product. Both these types of aquaculture are oriented towards the export market. Shrimp (crustaceans) and salmon (diadromous fishes) make up a lower volume than freshwater fishes such as tilapia and carp but attract a high price, making them a significant component in value terms. Production is dominated by Asian countries (Figure 12), particularly China which has reported increases in production of 0.7 million tonnes per year until 1992 and 2.6 millions tonnes per year thereafter. For the rest of the world, combined growth in production has averaged 0.4 million tonnes per year. Within the last decade, LIFDCs, excluding China, have shown an encouraging overall upward trend in production and, in terms of quantity, the increase has kept pace with that reported in non-LIFDCs (Figure 13). China and other Asian countries dominate LIFDC aquaculture production (Figure 14) because they have been much more active in promoting aquaculture, particularly for subsistence. While Asia, the Americas and Europe have seen an expansion in aquaculture production, Africa has been slow to develop its potential. Unlike Asia, Africa has little aquaculture tradition and has been affected by a number of external problems that have prevented proper management and development despite investment. Nevertheless, aquaculture production in Africa has risen from 37 000 tonnes in 1984 to 189 000 in 1998, the majority of which is freshwater carp and tilapia.  In the Asia region, aquaculture has developed mainly as a rural activity integrated into existing farming systems. Rural aquaculture, including enhancement and culture-based fisheries, has made significant contributions to the alleviation of poverty, directly through small-scale household farming of aquatic organisms for domestic consumption or income, and indirectly by providing employment for the poor or low-cost fish for poor rural and urban consumers. Recent experiences in these countries indicate that there are wide opportunities for the poor, who can integrate aquaculture into their existing farming systems.  All countries in the region have a large unfulfilled potential for growth, although rural aquaculture is far better developed in countries such as China and India. In China, significant expansion and intensification of aquaculture are taking place. Intensive systems, based increasingly on formulated feeds, are more common in coastal provinces, where small-scale farms account for 60 percent of production, while in poorer and remoter provinces traditional integrated systems, based mainly on manuring, still predominate. In India, rural aquaculture using extensive to semi-intensive modes of production in ponds and tanks contributes significantly to rural household incomes. In the Philippines, small-scale holders dominate coastal seaweed and mollusc farming. In Bangladesh, where most fish farmers are relatively poor, there is vast potential for the poorest members of society to become new entrant aquaculture farmers. In Nepal, poor fishers are the owner-operators of fish cages, while in the Philippines poor farmers are more likely to be hired to operate such systems and are less likely to be owners. In Indonesia, about 78 percent of farming households cultivate fish in small ponds of less than 500 m2, and aquaculture is the main source of income for 66 percent of the households that cultivate fish in paddies and ponds. Aquaculture is also the main source 
of income for 65 percent of households with brackish water ponds of an area less than 
1 ha. It has been reported that the traditional integrated farming system in Viet Nam may contribute as much to household income as rice cultivation, while occupying a far 
smaller area.  However, the contribution of rural aquaculture to development is uneven, suggesting that there is still significant unfulfilled potential. Rural aquaculture is increasingly recognized as a way to improve the livelihoods of poor people, and many governments and development agencies attach importance to this sector in the Asia and Pacific region.    Aquaculture still faces a number of problems. Among these are access to technology and financial resources for the poor; environmental impacts; and diseases. The priority areas for further research include: Although many policies are developed specifically for aquaculture, the resulting plans are often integrated with those of the capture fisheries sector. Aquaculture is seen not only as having greater development potential than capture fisheries, but also as an important tool for increasing food security. Many countries have identified a future shortfall in the supply of fishery products and support aquaculture development in order to avoid the importation of scarce fishery products.  Aquaculture is often proposed as a way of providing fish to non-coastal communities, high-value exports, seed stock for replenishing resources and bait for fisheries. As well as the development of new areas, most plans for aquaculture include support for areas that are underutilized as a result of inefficiencies in production, a common problem for many developing countries. Other significant issues addressed by management and development plans include disease control, conflicting land uses and general environmental problems arising from aquaculture development, such as critical habitat loss, species introductions and pollution.  The future development of aquaculture will depend on improvements in new and adaptive research and management. A framework for such cooperation, provided in the Bangkok Declaration and Strategy for Aquaculture Development Beyond 2000,8 is particularly important to developing countries, which need to share expertise and technology. Regional management of aquaculture is being developed for the Mediterranean region through the application of Article 9 of the Code. This is the first institutional attempt to harmonize the different national principles connected with the Code. The principles address integrated and improved planning with the participation of all sectors, environmental conservation and economic and trade issues.  Since 1994, there has been a tendency to increase the proportion of fisheries production used for direct human consumption rather than for other purposes (Figure 15). Of the products for human consumption, fresh fish showed significant growth during the 1990s, complemented by a decline in the use of canned fish. This pattern has largely been driven by growth in consumption, which increased the demand for fresh fish and caused a slight decline in other uses (Figure 16). Fish has a significant capacity for processing. In 1998, only 36 percent of world fisheries production was marketed as fresh fish, while the remaining 64 percent underwent some form of processing. Fish for human consumption had a 79.6 percent share, while the remaining 20.4 percent went to non-food purposes, almost exclusively for reduction to meal and oil. Of the fish destined for direct human consumption, fresh fish was the most important product, with a share of 45.3 percent, followed by frozen fish (28.8 percent), canned fish (13.9 percent) and cured fish (12 percent). Fresh fish increased in volume from 25 million tonnes in 1988 to 42 million tonnes in 1998, live weight equivalent. Processed fish (frozen, cured and canned) increased from 46 million tonnes in 1988 to more than 51 million tonnes, live weight equivalent, in 1998.  The total food fish supply has been growing at a rate of 3.6 percent per annum since 1961, while the world's population has been expanding at 1.8 percent per annum. The proteins derived from fish, crustaceans and molluscs account for between 13.8 and 16.5 percent of the animal protein intake of the human population.    Total food fish supply grew from 27.6 million tonnes in 1961 to more than 93 million tonnes at the end of the twentieth century. Average apparent per capita consumption increased from about 9 kg per annum in the early 1960s to 16 kg in 1997. The per capita availability of fish and fishery products has therefore nearly doubled in 40 years, outpacing population growth, which also nearly doubled in the same period. In industrialized countries, where diets generally contain a more diversified range of animal proteins, the supply increased from 13.2 million tonnes in 1961 to 26.7 million tonnes in 1997, implying a rise in per capita provision from 19.7 to 27.7 kg. This represents a growth rate close to 1 percent per annum. In this group of countries, fish contributed an increasing share of total protein intake until 1989 (accounting for between 6.5 and 8.5 percent), but its importance has gradually declined since then and, in 1997, its percentage contribution was back to the level prevailing in the mid-1980s.  In the early 1960s, per capita fish supply in LIFDCs was, on average, one-fifth of that of the richest countries. The gap has gradually lessened, however, and in 1997 average LIFDC fish consumption was close to half that of the more affluent economies. If China is excluded, per capita supply in LIFDCs increased from 4.9 to 7.8 kg over the period - an annual growth rate of 1.3 percent.  Despite the relatively low consumption by weight in LIFDCs, the contribution of fish to total animal protein intake is considerable (nearly 20 percent). Over the last four decades, however, the share of fish proteins to animal proteins has exhibited a slight negative trend owing to faster growth in the consumption of other animal products. As well as income-related variations, the role of fish in nutrition shows marked continental, regional and national differences (Figure 17). For example, of the 93.9 million tonnes available worldwide for consumption in 1997, only 5.2 million tonnes were consumed in Africa (with a per capita supply of 7.1 kg), whereas two-thirds of the total were consumed in Asia - 31.7 million tonnes in Asia excluding China (13.7 kg per capita) and a similar amount in China alone (where the apparent supply amounted to 25.7 kg per capita). Currently, two-thirds of the total food fish supply are obtained from fishing in marine and inland waters; the remaining one-third is derived from aquaculture. The contribution of inland and marine capture fisheries to per capita food supply has stabilized (at 10 to11 kg per capita in the period 1984-1998). Recent increases in per capita availability have, therefore, been obtained from aquaculture production, from both traditional rural aquaculture and intensive commercial aquaculture of high-value species. On average, for all countries in the world except China, aquaculture's contribution to per capita food availability grew from 1.2 kg in 1984 to 2.1 kg in 1998 - at an average rate of 4.1 percent per annum. In China, where fish farming practices have long traditional roots, the per capita supply from aquaculture is reported to have increased from 6 kg to nearly 17 kg in the same period, implying an annual average growth of 15 percent.  The total amount of fish consumed and the species composition of the food supply vary according to region and country, reflecting the different levels of natural availability of aquatic resources in adjacent waters, as well as diverse food traditions, tastes, demand and income levels. Demersal fish are much preferred in northern Europe and North America, and cephalopods are consumed in several Mediterranean and Asian countries, but to a much lesser extent in other regions.  Despite the fast-growing contribution of aquaculture to production, crustaceans are still high-priced commodities and their consumption is mostly concentrated in affluent economies. Of the 16.1 kg of fish per capita available for consumption in 1997, the vast majority (75 percent) was finfish (Figure 18). Shellfish supplied 25 percent - or 4 kg per capita, subdivided into 1.4 kg of crustaceans, 2.2 kg of molluscs and 0.4 kg of cephalopods.  In terms of total supply, 25 million tonnes were made up of freshwater and diadromous species. Marine finfish species provided 45 million tonnes, subdivided into 16 million tonnes of demersal species, 19 million tonnes of pelagics and 10 million tonnes of unidentified and miscellaneous marine fish. The remaining 20 percent of the food supply was shellfish, comprising 8 million tonnes of crustaceans, 2.5 million tonnes of cephalopods and 13 million tonnes of other molluscs. Historically, there have not been dramatic changes in most of the broad groups' shares in average world consumption: demersal fish species have stabilized at about 2.7 kg per capita and pelagic fish at 3.2 kg. Two groups are exceptions in that they showed considerable increases between 1961 and 1997: the availability of crustaceans per capita more than trebled from 0.4 to 1.4 kg, largely because of the production of shrimps and prawns from aquaculture practices; and molluscs similarly increased from 0.6 to 2.2 kg per capita.  Fish contributes up to 180 calories per capita per day, but reaches such high levels only in a few countries where there is a lack of alternative protein foods grown locally and where a preference for fish has been developed and maintained (examples are Japan, Iceland and some small island states). More typically, fish provides about 20 to 30 calories per day. Fish proteins are essential and critical in the diet of some densely populated countries, where the total protein intake level may be low (e.g. fish contributes more than or close to 50 percent of total proteins in Bangladesh, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Republic of Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Indonesia, Japan and Senegal), and it is very important in the diets of many other countries (e.g. Cambodia, Benin, Angola and the Republic of Korea).  Worldwide, about 1 billion people rely on fish as their main source of animal proteins. Dependence on fish is usually higher in coastal than in inland areas. About 20 percent of the world's population derives at least 20 percent of its animal protein intake from fish (Figure 19), and some small island states depend on fish almost exclusively. Fish is traded widely - mostly as a frozen food, and increasingly less as a canned or heavily dried food. Its trade has been stimulated by the economic conditions prevailing in most consumer markets and by notions about the health benefits of seafood consumption. In response to higher prices in recent years, production from aquaculture has had a positive influence on supply and consumer prices. However, in 1998 import demand in some important markets was sharply reduced. Although, in some cases, the weak import demand for certain species resulted from increased domestic production, more generally it was a result of the financial crisis affecting some of the more rapidly growing industrial economies. In addition, the global economic crisis, which began in the summer of 1997 and spread rapidly through East Asia to the Russian Federation and Latin America, dominated the world economy and resulted in reduced trade and lower commodity prices in seafood products. In Japan, the world's largest fish-consuming country and import market, domestic supply remained at more than 8 million tonnes with small fluctuations until 1995, but since then the trend has been to decrease.  Over the last two years, the consumption of fish and fishery products has been strongly influenced by the economic crisis in the Asian countries, in particular Japan. The crisis and the subsequent low value of the yen led to a decline in imports and consumptionin 1998. The main supplying countries had to reduce prices and find alternative outlets for their production. In 1999, the Japanese economy started to recover, but not as quickly as originally forecast because Japanese people were not spending as freely as they had done before the crisis. Food items that consumers consider to be expensive have had difficulty in regaining their pre-crisis market shares. On the other hand, the United States economy has been particularly strong, and consumption of fish continues to increase in that country. The northern European market was strong in the second part of 1999 because of good economic conditions and higher consumption in restaurants. Europe is not the only region to be experiencing a general trend of increased fish consumption in restaurants as people spend more on eating out. Dietary habits are changing, especially in developed countries. Markets have become more flexible and new products and species have found market niches. The trend is for fish to receive greater value added in the catering and retail markets, thus making it easier for consumers to prepare.  Alongside traditional preparations, developments in food science and technology, combined with improved refrigeration and the use of microwave ovens, are making convenience foods, ready meals, coated fish products and other value-added items a fast-growing industry, especially in the EU and in the United States. The reasons for this rapid expansion include changes in social factors such as the increasing role of women in the workforce, the fragmentation of meals in households as well as the general decrease in average family size, and the increase in single-person households. The need for simple meals that are ready to eat and easy 
to cook has thus become more important. Another trend is the increasing importance of fresh fish. Unlike many other food products, fish is still more favourably received on the market when it is fresh rather than processed. However, historically, fresh fish has been of little importance in international trade owing to its perishable nature and very limited shelf-life. Improvements in packaging, reduced air freight prices, and more efficient and reliable transport have created additional sales outlets for fresh fish. Food chains and department stores are also taking an increasing share of the fresh seafood sector, and many have opened fresh seafood counters with an extensive variety of fish and freshly prepared fish dishes or salads next to their frozen food counters. Social changes have greatly influenced the structure of the fish and retail markets. Large food chains and department stores are increasingly common. More and more consumers are limiting their shopping to one day a week and tend to prefer larger food outlets for the sake of convenience.  The United States and EU markets for fishery products are expected to expand in coming years as a result of consumer health consciousness and belief in the positive impact that fish consumption can have on health. Healthy food is a growing concern in developed countries, and calorie counts, dietary and nutritional plans and recipes on packed fish are a useful addition to value-added products. Outside Japan, the consumption of sashimi and sushi is increasing in other Asian countries, the United States and Europe. In addition, the consumption of farmed species such as tilapia, catfish and salmon is an alternative to traditional products that are characterized by low supplies and high prices. The structure of the fish industry in developed countries is also changing. Large, vertically integrated multinational companies are buying smaller producers. Among the factors that could influence future demand for seafood products are population growth; changes in economic and social conditions (such as lifestyle and family structure); developments in fish production, processing, distribution and marketing strategies; and the prices of fish compared with those of competing foodstuffs. The price of chicken, for example, is making it increasingly attractive on all major markets, resulting in a shift in consumer interest away from fish and towards chicken. Furthermore, globalization and increasing international trade in seafood commodities, as well as international agreements on trade rules, tariffs, quality standards (see Fish quality and safety, Part 2) and fisheries management are all having an impact. Long-term global trends in supply and demand, including developments in distribution and consumption, have broad implications for the domestic industry and for domestic consumers. Projections of demand based on population and income growth point to an increasing gap between supply and demand, which could lead to an increase in prices. This, in turn, could lead to a widening of the existing gap in average fish consumption between developed countries and LIFDCs. The consumption trend, as far as species are concerned, points increasingly towards farmed species, whitefish, crustaceans and molluscs in the developed countries and to low-value species, such as small pelagics, in developing countries.    A large share of fish production enters international trade, with about 33 percent exported in 1998 (live weight equivalent). LIFDCs play an active part in this trade and, 
at present, account for almost 20 percent of exports. Developing countries as a whole supply nearly 50 percent of total exports in value terms. In 1998, total exports of fish and fishery products were US$51 300 million in value terms, a 3.8 percent decrease compared with 1997. More than 90 percent of trade in fish and fishery products consists of processed products in one form or another (i.e. excluding live and fresh whole fish). Frozen, fresh and chilled fish make up the majority of exports (Figure 20). Although live, fresh or chilled fish represents only a small share of world fish trade owing to its perishability, trade is growing, reflecting improved logistics and increased demand. In 1998, total imports of fish and fishery products were US$55 000 million, representing a slight decline of 2.8 percent compared with 1997 and 3.9 percent compared with 1996. Japan was again the largest importer of fishery products, accounting for some 23 percent of total imports, but Japanese imports of fish and fishery products have declined recently as a result of the economic recession (Figure 21). The EC further increased its dependence on imports for its fish supply. The United 
States, despite being the world's fifth major exporting country, was also its second main importer. More than 77 percent of the total world import value is concentrated in these three areas.  Shrimp is the main fish trade commodity in value terms, accounting for some 20 percent of the total value of internationally traded fishery products. The international economic crisis in the main producer countries and in their markets, together with disease problems, caused setbacks for shrimp producers, traders and investors in 1998 and 1999. The main producers had to reduce prices and look for alternative outlets in order to sell their production.  In 1998 and 1999, many shrimp-producing countries, particularly in South America, experienced a decline in production mainly owing to disease or weather problems. In Ecuador, Peru, Mexico, Bangladesh and India, shrimp production and exports were disappointing compared with previous years. In contrast, shrimp output in Thailand picked up in 1998 and 1999 after the disease problems of 1996 and 1997. This country continues to be the main shrimp-culturing nation in the world.  After poor trading in 1998, the Japanese shrimp market recovered in 1999, particularly in the second half of the year. The strong yen and high demand were the main reasons for this upturn. The United States market for shrimp was very active in 1999, with record shrimp consumption of 400 000 tonnes, 
330 000 tonnes of which were imported.  After a slow start, the European shrimp market was strong in the closing months of 1999. Trade improved in the northern part of the continent as a result of good economic conditions and higher consumption in restaurants. Spain is the main fresh and frozen shrimp importer among the EC countries, followed by France, the United Kingdom 
and Italy.  Tuna catches in 1999 were well ahead of those of 1998 in practically all major fishing areas. Catches in the Eastern Pacific, in particular (up by 40 percent on 1998), continued the positive trend experienced in 1998. Estimates put the 1999 tuna catch at close to a record of 4 million tonnes. The international tuna market was oversupplied during 1999 and this led to unprecedented low prices, which had already started to decline in mid-1998. In November 1999 skipjack was quoted in Bangkok at a low of US$400 per tonne. Japanese imports of fresh and frozen tuna were 307 400 tonnes in 1999, a 9.7 percent decrease compared with 1998. Japanese imports of canned tuna expanded slightly in 1999 to reach 21 000 tonnes.  The two main markets for canned tuna are the United States and the EC. While United States imports increased in 1999, the European market was rather weak. United States imports of canned tuna reached 151 700 tonnes in 1999, 32 percent more than the 1998 figure. Canned whitemeat still represents only a small share of United States canned tuna imports, but the product is expanding its presence. The United States accounts for about one-third of the world's canned tuna consumption, but consumption has decreased in recent years. The overall quality of canned tuna in the United States is declining, although the higher- quality segment is growing.  Italian canners' use of tuna loins as raw material is increasing, and loins account for about 60 percent of Italy's total canned tuna production. Spain is now the major tuna processor in Europe, having overtaken Italy.  After the United States, Thailand is the second largest producer of canned tuna in the world, and Thai tuna canning companies are promoting this product on domestic markets by highlighting its low cholesterol content.  A number of the main groundfish species have experienced reduced stocks and decreased quotas for several consecutive years. In the United States this development has made the market entry of new farmed species such as catfish and tilapia much easier, and in Europe salmon seems to be replacing groundfish. Low supplies of cod have increased the industry's interest in farming cod. However, there are 
not many alternatives on the market for 
such traditional products as salted and 
dried groundfish. Prices in the United 
States and Europe were relatively depressed 
in 1999, with an increase towards the end of the year.  Reduced supplies of traditional groundfish species seem to be compensated by increased sales of other products, especially ready-to-eat meals and farmed salmon. In general, world consumption of salmon is rising and farmed Atlantic salmon is becoming more popular, in fresh, smoked and canned forms. Farmed salmon production grew considerably in 1999, reaching nearly 890 000 tonnes compared with 798 000 tonnes in 1998. Chile experienced several problems with its farmed salmon production during 1999, and Norway increased its share in the United States market.  Cephalopod fisheries performed well in 1999, especially for Illex catches, and supplies on the world market were very strong. The increased supply of squid was initially absorbed without problems, with a strong buying interest reported in Spain and Japan. However, at the end of the year, demand declined suddenly and market prices started to drop.  Squid imports into Japan reached a high of 62 500 tonnes in 1999, almost 30 percent more than in 1998.  In 1999, Japanese cuttlefish imports dropped by 3.1 percent to 43 400 tonnes, with Thailand supplying nearly half of this total. Octopus catches in the Eastern Central Atlantic were good in 1999, leading to higher exports to Japan and lower prices on the world market.  In many of the countries that are not traditional cephalopod eaters, squid consumption is increasing. The best example is the United States, where ""calamari"" is now well established in fast-food chains. In countries with a low seafood consumption, such as Argentina, squid has found a market niche in the fried fast-food sector. The Russian Federation's financial problems led to a strong price drop in 1998, followed by an upwards trend in mackerel prices during the second half of 1999. Norwegian mackerel exports to the Russian Federation and the Baltic states fell by almost 50 percent between 1998 and 1999. Norway began to focus more on Asia and Eastern European countries such as Poland, Turkey and Ukraine.  In 1999, EC exports of Atlantic mackerel to Eastern Europe dropped compared with 1998, so the EC strongly increased its exports towards African markets (particularly Nigeria).  At the end of 1998, the world herring market collapsed as a result of an oversupply from the 1997/98 season and the economic crisis in the Russian Federation and Japan, the two major markets for herring. The world market price for herring dropped substantially, in some cases by 75 percent. In 1999, imports into Central and Eastern Europe started to pick up and it appears that the Russian Federation will again become the major importer of herring. Prices increased slightly in 1999. Fishmeal production for 1999 is estimated at 6.6 million tonnes, close to the annual average for 1976-1997 of 6.5 million tonnes. This is 29 percent up on the 4.8 million tonnes produced in 1998, which was one of the worst production years ever. Increased production was due to the recovery of fishing in South America after the El Niño phenomenon. Peruvian fishmeal production in 1999 was more than twice the 1998 figure of 815 000 tonnes, representing a return to normal levels. Export earnings from fishmeal increased by 35 percent in 1999 compared with 1998, reaching US$534 million. On the other hand, the situation in Chile did not completely return to normal. Total fishmeal output from this country was 980 000 tonnes in 1999, up from 640 000 tonnes in 1998, but still lower than the 1.2 million tonnes recorded in 1997. Chilean fishmeal exports in 1999 were close to 600 000 tonnes, some 100 000 tonnes more than in 1998.  Increased production led to a strong reduction of prices during 1999. Prices improved somewhat at the end of the year, 
but competition with soybean meal is still in fishmeal's favour. The present price ratio of 
2:1 is one of the lowest in recent history.  Fishmeal exports from the five main exporting countries doubled in 1999, to reach 2.85 million tonnes. China was the main importer, followed by Japan, Taiwan Province of China and Germany.  World fish oil production reached 1.2 million tonnes in 1999, up from 0.8 million tonnes in 1998. Latin American producers, Peru in particular, reported a strong increase in output, and fish oil production levels went back to pre-El Niño levels. The increase in fish oil availability was coupled with price reductions and, in December 1999, fish oil prices were around US$290 per tonne, compared with US$740 per tonne in mid-1998.  Fish oil use is now dominated by aquaculture, which takes 60 percent of total production. Low production levels in 1998 had a negative impact on the use of edible fish oil, while 1999 saw a recovery in the use of fish oil for direct human consumption. Trade in ornamental fish has been increasing since the 1980s. At present, total wholesale trade is estimated at US$900 million and total retail trade at about US$3 billion (live animals for aquariums only). Asia represents more than 50 percent of the world's total ornamental fish supply. Singapore is by far the leading exporter, followed by the United States, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Japan, Malaysia, the Czech Republic, Israel, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Fish farming is a leisure activity that is practised mainly 
in industrialized countries because it is relatively costly. The main importers are 
the United States, Japan and Europe, particularly Germany, France and the United Kingdom. 1 M. Bruton. 1995. Have fishes had their chips? The dilemma of threatened fishes. Environmental Biology of Fishes, 43: 1-27; and World Resources Institute at www.wri.org/wri/wr2000/index.html/.

                                 University of British Columbia, Canada University of Tasmania, Australia King's College London, United Kingdom Somali waters have high fisheries production potential, but the sustainability of those fisheries is compromised by the presence of foreign fishing vessels, many of them fishing illegally. The Somali domestic fishing sector is small and relatively nascent, but foreign vessels have fished in Somali waters for at least seven decades. Some foreign vessels and their crew have been a direct, physical threat to Somali artisanal fishers. Many foreign vessels directly compete for fish, reducing fish populations and destroying marine habitat through bottom trawling. In this paper, we reconstruct foreign catch in Somali waters from 1981–2014 and classify the health of seventeen commercial fish stocks. Foreign fishing has increased more than twenty-fold since 1981, and the most rapid increase occurred during the 1990s after the collapse of the Federal government and ensuing civil war. We estimate foreign fishing vessels caught 92,500 mt of fish in 2014, almost twice that caught by the Somali domestic fleet. Iran (48%) and Yemen (31%) accounted for the vast majority of foreign fish catch in the most recent year of analysis. Although responsible for only 6% of total foreign catch, trawl vessels disproportionately impact public perception of foreign fishing. We find they trawled over 120,000 km2 of marine seabed in nearshore waters during 2010–2014. Foreign IUU fishing in Somali waters is fueling public anger and perpetuating conflict in five ways: by directly competing with the domestic fishery; through links to piracy; through nearshore illegal and destructive bottom trawling; by contributing to regional political conflict over vessel licensing; and by reducing long-term livelihood security. Significant levels of foreign fishing combined with inconsistent governance means Somalis are not fully benefiting from the exploitation of their marine resources at a local or national level, leading to insecurity at both scales. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing by foreign fishing vessels in Somali waters has been problematic for decades (Musse and Tako, 1999; Lehr and Lehmann, 2007; Weldemichael, 2012; Sumaila and Bawumia, 2014). The central government collapsed in 1991, and the ensuing increase in foreign fishing became a justification for piracy against fishing vessels (Weldemichael, 2012; Sumaila and Bawumia, 2014). Successful pirate attacks and large ransom payments turned the attention of pirate gangs to more valuable merchant vessels. The growing risk of piracy caused some distant water fishing fleets targeting tuna to avoid Somali waters during the mid-2000s (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2013). While piracy has declined (Oceans Beyond Piracy, 2014), foreign fishing within sight of Somali communities continues to galvanize public anger (Anon, 2015b). Most foreign fishing in Somali waters is either illegal, unreported, or unregulated. The Somali Fisheries Law, passed in December 2014 (Federal Republic of Somalia Ministry of Natural Resources, 2014), banned bottom trawling by domestic and foreign vessels (Article 33), made all prior licenses null and void (Article 10), and reserved the first 24 nm of Somali waters for Somali fishers (Article 3). Prior to passage of this law, however, the designation as “legal” or “illegal” for any specific foreign vessel was politically and legally complicated. Before the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1972, Somalia designated its 200-nm zone a territorial sea. UNCLOS designates this the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Consequently, nations challenged Somalia’s territorial waters claim and used it as an excuse to fish in Somali waters beyond 12 nm without licenses. Foreign vessels also obtained licenses from non-governmental sources, such as local authorities, local leaders, or even warlords (Anon, 2010a; Sumaila and Bawumia, 2014; BBC, 2015). Corruption around these de facto licenses was widespread (Schbley and Rosenau, 2013), and captains and owners of foreign vessels were either ignorant of or complicit in such corruption. In some cases, license fees were exchanged for “protection” from pirates. Vessels from Yemen directly traded ice and fuel for access to fish in Somali waters (Lovatelli, 1996). All told, a significant number of foreign vessels took advantage of the instability in Somalia and never attempted to obtain a fishing license from any authority (Glaser et al., 2015). Disagreement and confusion over authority to issue licenses made many countries hesitant to engage in those modalities and encouraged some fleets to circumvent legal channels or refuse to fish in Somali waters at all. Finally, some fleets were offered protection by regional political elites–including protection from pirate attacks and the presence on-board of armed Somali guards–which destabilized the maritime space and the procurement of legal licenses (Dua, 2013). A significant amount of fishing in Somali waters goes unreported to the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS). Domestic and foreign vessels are now legally required to report all catch (Somali Fisheries Law, Article 24), but the FGS does not have the capacity to collect nationwide catch statistics, and they have not reported catch to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) since 1988 (Glaser et al., 2015). While foreign vessels that catch tuna should report to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), foreign vessels in Somali waters that are not catching species under IOTC management do not report to any agency. Finally, Somalia does not have sufficient management measures to regulate fishing in their waters. Existing regulations are not enforced, and scientific studies are decades old (Stromme, 1984). Consequently, detailed fisheries knowledge does not exist. Unregulated fishing increases the risk of overfishing, and management without regular scientific input can lead to resource depletion (Pitcher et al., 2002; Agnew et al., 2009). The presence of foreign fishing vessels has been a source of conflict in the Somali maritime space for decades. Here, we outline some of the mechanisms driving this conflict and provide quantitative support. This research builds from Glaser et al. (2015) with updated numbers and methods for estimating catch by foreign vessels. We argue all foreign fishing in Somali waters is unregulated, most is unreported to Somali authorities, and unknown amounts of it are illegal. Consequently, IUU fishing by foreign vessels is a significant threat to Somali fisheries. While the mere presence of foreign fishing vessels causes direct and visible conflict with the domestic sector, the indirect effects of foreign trawling and potential declines in valuable fish stocks exacerbates these effects. We combined three approaches: (1) spatial allocation of RFMO-reported catch of highly migratory species (HMS) done by the Sea Around Us (Cashion et al., 2018), (2) catch reconstruction, and (3) analysis of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) vessel broadcast data. Where available, we used information on catch composition to allocate catch into species or taxonomic groups. Following Pitcher et al. (2002), we created a detailed fishery timeline through extensive searches of the literature, expert interviews, and conversations with Somalis (available at http://securefisheries.org/sites/default/files/SomaliFisheriesTimeline.xlsx). We began our estimation in 1981, when foreign fishing began to proliferate. Catch of highly migratory species (HMS) was estimated using the spatialized industrial large pelagic catch data of the Sea Around Us at the University of British Columbia (Le Manach et al., 2016). This dataset harmonizes data from those Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) that manage large pelagic species fisheries including tuna, billfishes, and sharks and reconstructed discard estimates of these fisheries. Members of RFMOs report annually on the amount of fishing catch and effort by gear and location. For Somali waters, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) is the relevant RFMO and it manages 16 species of tuna and billfishes plus commonly caught shark species (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2010). Le Manach et al. (2016) provide a detailed and technical discussion of this methodology. We selected catch allocations provided by the Sea Around Us (seaaroundus.org, downloaded March 18, 2018) for fish catch in the Somali EEZ for commercial groups Tuna/Billfishes and Sharks/Rays for the following IOTC-reporting countries: China, France, Japan, South Korea, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Spain and Portugal are part of the EU party. Russia is no longer a party to the IOTC, but they were during the 1990s when they were fishing around Somalia. These countries have a history of reporting spatially explicit data to the IOTC and our creation of the fishery timeline documented a historical presence in Somali waters. We modified an established approach to catch reconstruction from Zeller et al. (2007) and Pauly et al. (2014) as follows: first, verify a nation’s fishing presence in Somali waters using searches of the literature and expert input; second, estimate the number of fishing vessels from a particular nation; third, estimate total catch by amount and species composition (where available) for that nation (referred to as anchor points); fourth, extrapolate catch between anchor point years; finally, generate 95% confidence intervals for catch reconstruction time lines using a Monte Carlo simulation and sampling ranges of vessel numbers and catch amounts (Glaser et al., 2015). Confidence intervals from the Monte Carlo simulation were used to provide estimates of uncertainty across all estimates. This reconstruction approach was used to estimate catch for Italy, Yemen, Iran, Egypt, Kenya, Greece, and Thailand. Details of reconstructions on a country-by-country basis follow. Italian vessels fished for tuna during the 1930s through 1950s, but data on volume and catch composition were not available. Three trawlers fishing for Amoroso e Figli operated during 1978–1979, but catch estimates were not available. We collected reliable information on trawlers operating through the joint ventures SOMITFISH (1981–1983) and SHIFCO (1987–2006) (Shifco, 1998). Our reconstruction posits the following: from 1981–1983 three trawlers were operating for SOMITFISH, and from 1987–1989 three trawlers were operating for SHIFCO. In 1987, SHIFCO added two trawlers to its fleet. These vessels were similar in capacity, ranging from 57–66 m in length. Vessels were flagged to Somalia until 1998, and that catch should be attributed to the Somali domestic fleet. Joint venture rules require catch from joint venture vessels be attributed to the flag country. Therefore, catch from these vessels during 1981–1998 should be included in volumes reported by Somalia to the FAO and in the domestic reconstruction of Cashion et al. (2018). When SHIFCO vessels were reflagged, catch should be considered foreign. We assign the flag to Italy because of the history of the joint venture and the exclusive purchasing rights of an Italian import company, Panapesca SpA. Records of catch and composition by the five SHIFCO trawlers were obtained from Panapesca SpA. Catch was reported in kilograms for various fishery taxa aggregated across all vessels but specific to a fishing campaign (approximately 55 days in length). Records covered August 2000 to September 2006. Annual catch (metric tons) was calculated from these records, and the average catch over the period of observation (3,440 mt) was extrapolated back from 1999 to 1990. Prior to 1990, catch was reduced to 60% of the average observed catch (2,064 mt) because only three trawlers were operating during that period. One trawler, the Antoinette Madre, operated in at least 1984 (Bihi, 1984). Two trawlers landed fish and lobster in 1985, and values (1,313 and 679 mt) were reported by Somali Democratic Republic Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources [MFMR] (1985). We used the average catch by these two trawlers to estimate catch for the Antoinette Madre in 1984 (996 mt). Finally, records (Somali Democratic Republic Ministry of Fisheries, and Marine Transport [MFMT], 1988) show five additional Italian trawlers operated in 1988 and we applied the average annual catch from the five SHIFCO vessels (3,440 mt) to this datum. This value is bolstered by a report (Van Zalinge, 1988) that one SHIFCO trawler landed 1,245 mt in 1987. Catch composition also was obtained from Panapesca record sheets. For most reporting periods, finfishes were aggregated across species. However, for records from August 2000 and September 2006, we obtained family level data. We applied this composition breakdown to the larger “fish” categories from remaining reporting periods. All five former SHIFCO vessels stopped operating in Somali waters in 2006 due to high fuel costs. One of the earliest mentions of fishing by Yemen occurs in Yassin (1981), in which he refers to a concern about shared resource management for the Indian oil sardine. There is no mention of Yemeni boats crossing over into Somali waters; it is implied that the resource spans both territories. Therefore, we take 1981 as an anchor point for which Yemeni catch in Somali waters was zero. Twelve Yemeni vessels were arrested in Somali waters in 2006 (our minimum number of vessels), and the UN claims as many as 300 Yemeni vessels fish in Somali waters each year (United Nations Security Council, 2013). The State Minister for Fisheries and Marine Resources in Puntland reported that Yemeni vessels carry between 3–7 mt of fish per trip, make three trips per month, and visit Somali waters each month out of the year (Kulmiye, 2010). Therefore, our Monte Carlo simulations of catch by Yemeni vessels calculated annual catch by sampling over a triangle distribution limited by minimums of 12 vessels per year and 108 mt per vessel, and maximums of 300 vessels per year and 252 mt per vessel. This estimate was applied to 2006–2014, and catch was linearly interpolated back to 1981 (where the anchor point was zero). Yemen reported catch to the IOTC during the period of 2003–2007, and we used the reported IOTC data to guide our species composition estimates: yellowfin (48%); other tunas such as longtail, narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, frigate tuna, and kawakawa (combined with undifferentiated tuna, 38%); and sharks (5%). All data reported to the IOTC originate from boats deploying handlines. Our approach to estimating catch from Iran was identical to that used to estimate catch by Yemen. Reports in the literature indicate Iran has a minimum of 5 (Anon, 2013) and a maximum of 180 gillnet vessels operating in Somali waters (United Nations Security Council, 2013). Capacity for fish on each vessel was not available. We therefore used global estimates for gillnet vessels to obtain a range of catch per year. Pauly et al. (2014) estimated catch capacity for gillnet vessels as 221 mt per year (average) and 1,211 mt per year (maximum). Waugh et al. (2011) estimated the minimum capacity of these vessels to be 16 mt per year. Our simulation therefore resampled triangle distributions estimating number of vessels and fish capacity. Trawling by Egyptian vessels began in 1981. Haakonsen (1983) reported “a few” and no more than 10 trawlers operating in the early 1980s, split between Italy and Egypt. Knowing Italy had three trawlers operating in 1981, we assigned a conservative three trawlers as an anchor point in 1981. Further, we assigned anchor points of 36 trawlers during 2003–2006 (Berbera Maritime and Fisheries Academy, 2013) and 34 trawlers in 2007 (Anon, 2012). Published estimates of catch by these trawlers are 30 mt per trawler per month; of that, 5% of catch was shrimp and the remainder was finfish. We extrapolated back to zero catch in 1981. Variable estimates of numbers of boats or capacity were not available, so we did not conduct Monte Carlo simulations to estimate confidence intervals. Since 2004, Kenyan trawlers fished for prawns along the Juba River on the border with Somalia (Bocha, 2012). Waldo (2009) reports 19 illegal trawlers caught 800 mt of prawns each year since that time. We did not conduct Monte Carlo simulations for Kenyan catch. Greek vessels have been trawling in Somali waters since the 1960s. “A few” trawlers were operating in the mid-1960s (Haakonsen, 1983) and “a number of” additional trawlers were fishing in 1983 (Bihi, 1984). From 1983–2010 we uncovered no evidence of trawling from Greece. In 2010, two Greek trawlers flagged to Belize, the Greko 1 and Greko 2, appeared. We therefore estimated two trawlers fishing in 1983 and two from 2010–2014. These vessels operated in Southern Somalia and may have been properly licensed. We found no information on catch rate but each vessel was 193 gross tonnage (GT, MarineTraffic.com, 2015), so we assumed the vessels were similar in catch composition and catch rate to the Korean-flagged trawlers described below. Therefore, we used the same fish catch per GT from the Korean trawlers (1.16 mt per GT) to the Greek trawlers, equaling 447 mt per year. From 2005 to 2009, seven Thai trawlers, owned by Sirichai, were licensed to fish year-round in Puntland. The trawlers operated continuously 6 months by transshipping to a Thai freezer ship in Somali waters, and they went to the port in Salalah (Oman) for repairs and unloading twice a year (Fry, 2009). We did not find reports of catch for these vessels. Given the similarity in location and gear, we used the reconstruction of catch for Korean trawlers (see below) for these vessels, equaling 785 mt of fish catch per year. Thai vessels reportedly stopped operating in Somali waters by 2009, although in 2018 their presence has again been observed. Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are used for collision avoidance and tracking of vessels at sea. Vessels greater than 300 GT, including fishing vessels, are required by the International Maritime Organization to broadcast AIS. Many fishing vessels smaller than 300 GT may broad AIS voluntarily for safety reasons. Preliminary observation of AIS pings (purchased from a subscription to ShipView) and expert input identified seven vessels flagged to South Korea that were likely bottom trawling in Somali waters. These vessels ranged in size from 49–68 m long and 439–888 GT. Using the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) numbers associated with these seven vessels, we purchased satellite AIS data for all seven boats from exactEarth (Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, March 26, 2015). These data include every broadcast point from the ships in question during July 2010 through December 2014. Each point includes a position (latitude/longitude) as well as associated vessel information such as IMO number, vessel name, flag, size, date, time, speed over ground (SOG), and course over ground. Vessel operators can control when and what they broadcast. Often points had missing information (e.g., SOG was not included in a broadcast) or AIS may have been turned off altogether, creating gaps in the dataset. As a result, estimates made from these data are conservative. Using ArcGIS 10.3, we identified transmissions within the boundaries of the Somali EEZ. Then, using SOG communicated during those transmissions, we classified where the vessels were actively trawling by creating a histogram of SOG (Figure 2), and choosing the range of speeds defining the peak in SOG. This method of using SOG distributions to identify trawling activity has been shown to correctly identify 99% of real trawling activity (Mills et al., 2006). Trawlers 2 and 6 were present in Somali waters and were likely trawling but did not broadcast SOG. Figure 2. Histogram of speed over ground (knots) reported by Automatic Identification System pings from seven South Korean-flagged trawlers during 2010–2014. Active trawling was classified from SOG distribution. Next, we used the times and dates of transmissions during active trawling to calculate the number of days trawled during the time period for which we had AIS data. If there were multiple transmissions at trawling speed in 1 day, we classified that as a trawling day. Each vessel was in Somali waters for differing durations, so we counted trawling days per boat and then calculated the ratio of active trawling days to the number of days in a year for which AIS transmissions were available. This ratio was then multiplied by 365, generating an estimate of days trawled per year for each vessel. Using the same procedure, we calculated the mean proportion of days trawled per month across all boats. To estimate active trawling days per month for the two vessels that did not broadcast SOG, we determined the number of days per month those two vessels were in the Somali EEZ, then multiplied by the mean proportion of days trawled calculated from the other boats during the associated month. Because the dataset for each boat did not always include an entire year of data at the beginning and end, we used a similar proportional method to estimate days trawling per year for all seven boats. For a single boat, we took the proportion of days trawled to the number of days over which we had data in a given year, then multiplied by the number of days in that year. We obtained ocean depth at the location of AIS transmission by overlaying transmission points with a bathymetry raster (GEBCO Compilation Group, 2019). To calculate the total area trawled, we used the mean SOG from all boats during active trawling and multiplied by a likely width of the trawl for vessels of comparable size (49 m; Gomez and Jiminez, 1994) and by the average number of hours spent trawling per day. For robustness, we also calculated straight-line distance trawled per boat per day. For each AIS transmission point, we drew a straight line to the next consecutive point, then calculated the combined distance of all the line segments for a single day. We multiplied this distance by the assumed width of the trawl to get a second estimate of total trawled area. Weight and species composition of catch were obtained from catch certificates submitted to the European Union for two of the vessels. The dated certificates spanned 7 months and contained catch by species of fish and invertebrates for each month. From the AIS data, we know how many days per month those two trawlers were operating in Somali waters. To estimate catch per day for a trawler, we divided catch per month by the number of days trawled in the same month. The sustainability of fish stocks in Somali waters has never been assessed, and most stocks lack the data necessary for national-level stock assessment. We classified the sustainability of Somalia’s fish stocks at current levels of foreign and domestic catch using methods developed for data-poor fisheries (Costello et al., 2012). We chose species groups that are commercially valuable and had sufficient data for analysis, excluding tuna and billfishes. These latter groups are analyzed by the IOTC and we report their sustainability classifications. We used our estimates of catch for dolphinfish, emperors, goatfish, jacks, clupeids (sardines), snappers, sharks, rays, groupers, and grunts. Sustainability was classified based on models used to predict the ratio of biomass (B) to biomass needed for maximum sustainable yield (BMSY). We used the panel regression model developed by Costello et al. (2012) to estimate B/BMSY for these ten fish groups. Where catch time series were reported for species, they were aggregated up to the family (or near-family) level. We combined catch reconstructions of Somali domestic fisheries (Persson et al., 2015; Cashion et al., 2018) with our estimates of foreign fishing to create estimates of total catch for these species groups. B/BMSY is a measure of the current standing stock (B) of a fish stock compared to the biomass needed to support MSY. For B/BMSY < 1.0, biomass is below that needed for MSY, and fishing should be reduced to improve sustainability. For B/BMSY > 1.0, biomass is above that needed for MSY, and fishing levels should stay the same or potentially increase. B/BMSY is a function of a suite of fishery characteristics, including (but not limited to) life history characteristics such as size, growth patterns, or age at reproductive maturity, and catch characteristics such as how quickly a fishery developed, how long it has existed, or whether catch has peaked. Costello et al. created a regression model that relates B/BMSY to these characteristics. They analyzed 204 assessed (data-rich) stocks from around the world. The B/BMSY calculated for these stocks was validated by independent stock assessments. Six nested regression models, each containing a different set of explanatory variables to accommodate varying data availability, were generated. Next, the coefficients estimated for these 204 stocks were then applied to 1,793 unassessed (data-poor) stocks to estimate B/BMSY. We used their published coefficients on each catch time series mentioned above. Specifically, for fishery i, fish family type j, and calendar year t, a multivariate panel regression model estimated B/BMSY as: where α is a constant term, β relates the fishery characteristic Xijt to B/BMSY, γi is a family fixed effect, δ is a time trend effect, and eijt is an error term. For the fish groups we included, data for fish maximum length were available but von Bertalanffy K, geographic distribution, and temperature preference were not uniformly available. We therefore chose Model 5 published in Costello et al.’s supplementary materials. Most parameters were calculated directly from the time series of catch. Maximum length data were obtained from FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2014). We created a database of over 800 species known to occur in Somali waters (available at http://securefisheries.org/report/securing-somali-fisheries) and these species guided our choice of length values to select from FishBase. To calculate a length value to include in the regression model, for a given family/species group, we averaged maximum length values for the species that occur in Somali waters. Although the Cashion et al. (2018) domestic reconstruction extends back to 1950, we truncated the time series to cover only 1981–2014 to overlap with our foreign reconstruction. Catch data were most robust from 1981–1987 due to relatively more reliable data collection and reporting by the Ministry of Fisheries under the Siad Barre regime (Fry, 2009). Following Costello et al., we further truncated catch time series to begin once catch reached 15% of the maximum value in the record. This reduces noise associated with behavior attributed to fishery “ramp-up” in the early years of a fishery. For most series, the value in 1981 was greater than 15% of maximum catch, so no further truncation was applied. All analyzed catch time series had at least 7 years of continuous data, the minimum required by Costello et al. to make the approach valid. We report sustainability classifications for IOTC-assessed species (yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, skipjack tuna, swordfish, longtail tuna, blue marlin, and striped marlin) based on their formal stock assessments. Given these highly migratory species are in Somali waters only part of the year, our estimates of annual catch for them in Somali waters are not appropriate for the panel regression approach to classification. Additionally, IOTC brings expert analysis and knowledge to bear on these species. Their approach calculates B/BMSY as well as F/FMSY (where F is fishing mortality). They classify sustainability according to a red-orange-yellow-green 4-cell contingency (e.g., Indian Ocean Tuna commission [IOTC], 2014) that incorporates B/BMSY and F/FMSY. To make their analysis comparable to ours, we translated those species classified as orange to green, and those classified as yellow to red. For current stock assessments and classifications, see http://www.iotc.org/science/status-summary-species-tuna-and-tuna-species-under-iotc-mandate-well-other-species-impacted-iotc. We estimate foreign fishing vessels operating in the EEZ of Somalia landed approximately 2,521,318 mt of fish between 1981 and 2014 (Table 1 and Figure 1). During that same period, Somali domestic fishing vessels caught only 1,182,995 mt (Cashion et al., 2018). In 2014, foreign vessels caught 92,537 mt, nearly twice as much as the Somali domestic catch of 54,177 mt. The peak of foreign fishing occurred in 2003 (132,458 mt) as smaller regional fleets became firmly established, but before distant water fleets withdrew from Somali waters to reduce the risk of piracy (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2008). In 2014, Iran and Yemen accounted for 79% of all fish caught by foreign vessels in Somali waters. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates. Our Monte Carlo simulations of Yemen and Iran provide confidence intervals, which are quite wide. For estimates based on reported catch, there are not estimates of uncertainty but the point estimates should be considered a minimum. Table 1. Catch (mt) of by foreign-flagged fishing vessels in Somalia’s exclusive economic zone. Figure 1. Estimated (reconstructed) catch by foreign and domestic fishing vessels in Somalia’s exclusive economic zone, 1981–2014. Domestic catch reconstruction by Cashion et al. (2018). Fishing by distant water fishing nations in Somali waters has declined significantly in recent years. These fleets of purse seine and longline vessels target tuna and other large pelagics as they migrate through the Western Indian Ocean. In 2003, we estimate these fleets caught about 44,000 mt of HMS in Somali waters. The decline in catch around 2005 was driven by several factors: the movement of all purse seine vessels out of Somali waters (Chassot et al., 2010), the southward movement of the purse seine and longline fleets (Indian Ocean Tuna commission [IOTC], 2014), and a peak in pirate activity (Oceans Beyond Piracy, 2015) that caused vessels to avoid Somali waters. In 2014, we estimate distant water fishing nations caught only 532 mt of HMS in Somali waters. Fishing by Italian vessels in Somali waters follows their colonization of the Horn of Africa. As early as the 1930s, Italy operated two tuna canneries in northern Somalia (Bihi, 1984). Italian vessels fished for tuna through the 1950s and trawling for coastal demersal fishes (mostly reef-associated) and cephalopods lasted from the late 1970s until 2006. We estimate Italian trawlers landed 74,000 mt of fish between 1981–2006. After Italian trawlers departed in 2006, South Korean trawlers took over the same fishing grounds and export market. We find fishing boats from Yemen began appearing in the waters around Somalia, especially near Somaliland, in the early 1980s (Yassin, 1981). At the time, arrangements between Yemeni and Somali fishers was mutually agreeable and access agreements were available. In Puntland, Yemeni fishers purchased fish from Somali fishers and, until recently, this was a major trade. Yassin (1981) anticipated future conflict over the migrating Indian oil sardine if cross-border fishing continued. We estimate that, in the most recent years of analysis, Yemen caught 28,970 mt of fish in Somali waters each year (CI90% = 11,094–50,076 mt). The civil war in Yemen, which began in 2015, has significantly reduced the number of Yemeni vessels coming to fish in Somali waters (Glaser, 2015). Iran’s recorded fishing fleet had about 6,363 boats in 2007, 1,296 of which are authorized by the IOTC to fish outside Iranian waters (Waugh et al., 2011). In recent years, we estimate Iranian vessels catch about 44,850 mt of tuna and sharks each year (CI90% = 8,988–104,150 mt). IOTC reports show most of this catch to be yellowfin and skipjack tuna, and the gillnet vessels have significant amounts of bycatch including billfishes, sharks, rays, and mammals (Waugh et al., 2011). Somali officials have recently focused their attention on fishing by Iranian vessels, and they formally accused Iran of fishing illegally by submitting evidence to the IOTC in 2015 (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2015). In the early 1980s, Egyptian trawlers took over the fishing niche previously filled by the Soviet joint venture SOMALFISH (Yassin, 1981). We estimate 34 trawlers caught 12,240 mt per year (2007–2014) and 36 trawlers caught 12,960 mt per year (2003–2006). These trawlers appear to have obtained licenses from the government of Somaliland through the mid-2000s. However, public opinion and law enforcement has shifted against these trawlers recently. Licenses to Egypt were ended by Somaliland in 2012 (Government of Somaliland Ministry of Trade and Investment, 2014). In 2009, two trawlers were arrested By Somaliland forces in Las Koreh (Anon, 2010b) and another was arrested in 2014 (BBC, 2014). Since 2004, Kenya has operated trawlers that target prawns near the mouth of the Juba River along the border with Somalia (Bocha, 2012). Waldo (2009) reported nineteen illegal trawlers caught a total of 800 mt annually. The Kenyan prawn fishery has been accused of contributing to the bycatch of endangered sea turtles that nest along the Somalia-Kenya border (Megalommatis, 2008). Recently, fishing in these waters has been banned by the Kenyan government in response to concerns about the presence of Al-Shabaab. Trawlers from Greece started fishing in Somali waters in the 1960s but we found no reports of their presence between 1983 and 2010. In 2010, two trawlers, the Greko 1 and Greko 2, began operating and we estimate they catch 447 mt of fish per year. These two vessels have become controversial. In 2016, Somalia asked for help from regional ports to prevent the Greko 1 from landing its catch. At that point, Somali officials denied Greko 1 was legally licensed and the vessel has been under investigation by FISH-i Africa, a regional information sharing task force (Stop Illegal Fishing, 2017). Thai fishing vessels have been documented in Puntland from at least 2005 to 2009. The Puntland Coast Guard supplied three officers to protect a Thai trawler owned by the Thai seafood company Sirichai around 2006 (Puntland State of Somalia Office of Coast Guard Forces, 2006). The company owned and operated seven licensed trawlers in Puntland’s waters. The growing threat of piracy caused Thai vessels to leave Somali waters. In November 2008, the trawler Ekawatnava 5 was sunk by the Indian navy when it mistook the vessel for a pirate mothership. Fourteen Thai crew members were killed (United Nations Security Council, 2013). The Thai Union 3 was hijacked in October 2009 and its crew held until March 2010. We estimate these trawlers caught 5,495 mt each year from 2005–2009. Catch records and AIS transmissions suggest seven South Korean-flagged trawl vessels caught 27,475 mt during 2010–2014, or approximately 5,495 mt of catch attributable to this fleet. Based on import records, catch consisted largely of cephalopods (cuttlefish = 20%, squid = 19%). Most fish catch was emperors (Lethrinidae; 17%), followed by barracudas (Sphyraenidae; 9%), and grunts (Haemulidae; 7%). Each of these vessels was present and actively trawling in Somali waters for an average of 229 days per year (Table 2). During May through January, these vessels trawled 73 to 87% of days in any given month. Trawling was reduced during the period of heavy seas in February through April, occurring during 34 to 62% of days in these months. Table 2. Days per year spent actively trawling within Somalia’s exclusive economic zone boundaries for seven South Korean-flagged vessels. Figure 3 shows the location of trawling; the vast majority occurred in inshore waters of Puntland because the government of Puntland has regularly issued trawling licenses to foreign fleets. Additionally, the continental shelf topology facilitates high fish abundance. Ninety-five percent of all trawling we tracked occurred inside the 75 m depth contour (Figure 3). Figure 3. Density of AIS pings during active bottom trawling from seven South Korean-flagged trawlers during 2010–2014. The mean SOG from all boats during trawling was 3.9 knots. Multiplying by the assumed width of the trawl for vessels of comparable size (49 m, Gomez and Jiminez, 1994) and by the average number of hours trawling per day (8.4 h) and converted into km2, we estimate each vessel trawled 3 km2 per day of active trawling. Multiplied by the number of days trawled per year by each boat, we estimate this fleet trawled 120,652 km2 during 2010 – 2014. Our robustness check generates a similar estimate. Total straight-line distance trawled was 2318 km. Multiplied by the assumed width of the trawl (49 m), a second estimate of the trawled area is 113,593 km2. We classify as unsustainable 10 of 17 fish groups included in our analysis (Figure 4), including swordfish, striped marlin, yellowfin tuna, longtail tuna, emperors (including the commercially important spangled emperor, Lethrinus nebulosus), goatfish (Mullidae), snappers (Lutjanidae), sharks, groupers (Serranidae), and grunts (including the commercially important painted sweetlips, Diagramma pictum). Figure 4. Sustainability classification of commercially important fish groups caught in Somali waters. This data-poor approach has limitations that should be considered. We analyzed groups of fishes that ranged from taxonomic organization at the species level (e.g., skipjack tuna) to superorder (e.g., sharks; see Figure 5). For those groups whose catch series came from catch reconstruction, there is higher levels of autocorrelation. However, Costello et al. (2012) found results were robust to assumptions of catch underreporting and misreporting. Our approach imposes a brightline (B/BMSY = 1.0) for the classification of sustainability (above 1.0 = sustainable), but small changes in reconstruction series could cause a group to cross that line. Finally, our classification approach does not distinguish those groups which are need immediate conservation measures. Figure 5. Sustainability analysis for sharks based on estimated B/BMSY using catch reconstructions for foreign and domestic fleets in Somali waters. When estimated catch (dashed line) exceeds B/BMSY (solid line), the fishery is classified as unsustainable. Since 1981, foreign fishing in Somali waters has been characterized by: purse seine and longline distant water fleets from Europe and Asia that target HMS, fish offshore, and tend to report to management authority of the IOTC; nearshore trawling for coastal species by various nations including South Korea, Greece, Italy, and Kenya; and gillnet or artisanal fishing by regional fishing nations such as Yemen and Iran that appear to fish for a wide variety of species, including sardine, tuna, and sharks. Both the reality and perception of foreign fishing has perpetuated instability in Somalia. Somalis have accused foreign vessels of shooting at them (Katz, 2012), spraying them with boiling water, and purposely destroying their fishing gear. Some fishers claim they fear for their lives from aggressive foreign vessels (Lehr and Lehmann, 2007). Growing public anger has caused a backlash against foreign fishing. For example, Egyptian trawlers that had once received legal fishing licenses have recently been arrested (BBC, 2014). We propose five mechanisms by which foreign IUU fishing drives instability in Somalia: (1) foreign competition with domestic fleets for fish, (2) links between foreign fishing and piracy, (3) effects of nearshore trawling, (4) conflict between state and federal governments over modalities for licensing foreign vessels, and (5) a long-term reduction in livelihood security. The presence of foreign fishing vessels in Somali waters is not inherently problematic, but if there is strong overlap in the target species, we expect higher levels of conflict to evolve. Comparing the catch of commercially important fish groups by foreign (this study) and domestic (Cashion et al., 2018) fleets over the past decade (2005–2014), we find overlap to be significant (Figure 6). Of the 18 species groups caught by foreign vessels, 15 are also caught by domestic fishers. Our sustainability analysis showed that five of the species groups caught by both foreign and domestic fishers are currently being fished at unsustainable levels. These include sharks, emperors, groupers, snappers, and goatfishes, which equal 56% of domestic catch during the most recent decade. Furthermore, tuna stocks are targeted by both fleets, and two of four species commonly caught in Somali waters are classified as unsustainable by IOTC. The similarity in catch composition suggests foreign gillnet vessels are likely competing for access to the same fishing grounds as the domestic fleet, especially for demersal species such as emperors and groupers. Our AIS analysis shows foreign trawlers have been operating well within the 24-nm territorial sea reserved for Somali fishers in the Somali Federal law. Figure 6. Overlap of catch composition for foreign and domestic fleets fishing in Somali waters. Total catch per species group calculated from catch estimates during 2005–2014. For context, however, it is important to note that fishing has not been a large contributor to income or diet in Somalia. Current estimates are that only 30,000 fishers live in Somalia, but there is a lack of solid, current information on the number of fishers in Somali fishing communities. Additionally, cultural attitudes toward fish eating and ocean conditions that hamper fishing activity in many parts of the year have limited the significance of fishing to the overall Somali economy (Yassin, 1981). In the literature, piracy is frequently linked to IUU fishing (Murphy, 2011; Sumaila and Bawumia, 2014). After the beginning of the civil war in 1991, Somali waters were left without legitimate capacity for enforcement of maritime sovereignty or boundary integrity. Organized groups of fishers began targeting first foreign fishing vessels and later, commercial traffic, partly in response to the perception that the international community ignored or even encouraged illegal fishing (Lehr and Lehmann, 2007). Initially, these attacks were limited to small-scale theft. In 1994, two SHIFCO fishing vessels were hijacked and the crew were held and then released for ransom, leading to an escalation in pirate tactics (Kulmiye, 2001). These small-scale attacks were quickly appropriated by warlords with criminal networks and international financing. These criminals sought to maximize profit above all else by attacking any vessels passing in and beyond Somali waters (Hansen, 2011; Schbley and Rosenau, 2013). At the same time, warlords sold licenses to foreign vessels in return for protection against pirate attacks (Sumaila and Bawumia, 2014). By 1998, these agreements had ended because, for the most part, warlords did not provide the protection they promised. By the early 2000s, loosely organized pirate gangs had fully evolved to a highly organized business model that brought in substantial currency (Burale, 2005) and targeted any vessel passing in and beyond Somali water, not just fishing vessels (Schbley and Rosenau, 2013). Finally, adding to the complexity, the warlords who justified their actions through protection of Somalis had actually enabled IUU fishing by providing armed security and legal means to obtain licenses (Oceans Beyond Piracy, 2015). The international community deployed NATO-led naval vessels to patrol waters around Somalia to tackle piracy, but very little has been done to stop illegal fishing. Some Somalis see this as tacitly enabling illegal fishing (African Development Solutions, 2015). Pirate attacks, which in 2014 were reduced to zero successful (reported) attacks, have again targeted fishing vessels. Several Iranian fishing vessels were captured in April 2015, and at least 37 fishers were taken hostage (Oceans Beyond Piracy, 2015). A second Iranian vessel, likely fishing illegally, ran out of fuel and drifted onto shore in El-Dheer, an Al Shabaab stronghold in 2015 (Anon, 2015c). After paying a “fishing fee,” the crew and cargo were released. Foreign trawlers operated in Somali waters from the mid-1970s until 1991 as joint ventures. Specially, agreements between the Somali federal government allowed joint ventures with Italy, Egypt, Greece, Japan, France, the Soviet Union, Singapore, and Iraq (Glaser et al., 2015). Most of these licensed ventures dissolved after 1991 but many of the trawlers continued operating. Thirty-six trawlers from Egypt operated along the northern coast. Five Italian vessels belonging to SHIFCO operated until 2006, at which time South Korean trawlers took over. Two Greek trawlers, the Greko 1 and 2, have operated since 2010. According to the 2014 Somali Fisheries Law (Article 33.1), all bottom trawling is illegal. Today, bottom trawling is illegal under the new Somali Fisheries Law (Article 33.1). The damage done to the benthic ecosystem is impossible to assess because there is no scientific baseline for comparison (Anon, 1976; Stromme, 1984). In this study, we estimate seven trawlers alone trawled over 120,000 km2 in 5 years. We argue these estimates are conservative and likely underestimates because they were strictly derived from observable AIS tracks that were voluntarily transmitted. While we do not know the specific effects of this trawling on the Somali marine environment, a large body of literature on bottom trawling shows tremendous and long-lasting negative impacts due to high mortality of bycatch (Alverson et al., 1994), disruption to biogeochemical systems linking the water column to the benthos (Pilskaln et al., 1998), and significant reductions in biodiversity and productivity due to high mortality on the benthic community (corals, sponges, echinoderms, and mollusks (Dayton et al., 1995; Kaiser et al., 2006). Four decades of unregulated and unreported bottom trawling means there is a high likelihood that considerable ecosystem damage has already occurred (Glaser et al., 2015). A global meta-analysis showed trawling of the type occurring in Somali waters (otter trawling) removes 6% of organisms with each pass over an area (Hiddink et al., 2017), and Kaiser et al. (2006) showed that a 20% recovery of trawl-impacted ecosystems could take more than 8 years. For the most heavily trawled locations (Figure 3), benthic communities might never recover before being disturbed again (Collie et al., 2000). Unclear governance structures have resulted in conflicting guidelines for ports in which trawl vessels attempt to land their catch. In 2015, two trawlers left Mogadishu with a cargo of fish (Anon, 2015a). These vessels were then inspected in Mombasa, Kenya. Somali authorities prevented at least one of these trawlers from landing in Salalah, Oman (EJF, 2015) by invoking the Port State Measures Agreement, an international agreement to which Oman is a signatory and which clamps down on IUU fishing. Eventually, though, one trawler landed its cargo in Yemen, while the other successfully unloaded in Oman after presenting a license from Puntland (Stop Illegal Fishing, 2016). The South Korean-owned vessels continued to fish in Somali waters intermittently through 2017. Four of the vessels reflagged to Somalia in 2015. A fifth vessel’s activity ended in dramatic fashion in 2015 when it sank off the coast of Puntland. The crew was rescued by the Puntland Maritime Police Force. In early 2017, seven Thai-owned, Djibouti-flagged trawlers were operating off the coast of Puntland. Though their operation is in direct violation of the federal Somali fishing law, they successfully petitioned the Puntland Government for fishing licenses and operated for 6 weeks, when they were joined by a reefer vessel which presumably picked up their illegal catch. These vessels’ blatant disregard for federal law, in addition to the suspicion of human rights violations on board including slavery and human trafficking, led many of the vessels to be detained in various locations and charges have been filed against individuals associated with the vessels and the direct or beneficial ownership companies (Stop Illegal Fishing, 2018). Recently, bottom trawling has come under scrutiny by international bodies and by local fishing communities (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2015). Trawling in shallow water–and hence close to shore–draws attention to their activities when visible to coastal communities. Some trawlers have reflagged to Somalia in an effort to circumvent the law (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2015). However, bottom trawling is illegal for domestic as well as foreign vessels. Trawlers have come to symbolize the conflict between domestic and foreign fishing fleets in Somalia (Kulmiye, 2010; Coastal Development Organization, 2013; Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2015). The competition for space in these productive fishing areas has led to antagonistic behavior by foreign vessels toward Somalis. Incidents like these could increase as resources decline, intensifying competition for dwindling resources. Somali authorities have worked to draw international attention to illegal foreign fishing. In April 2015, the Somali delegation presented evidence of illegal fishing at the annual IOTC conference, including vessel tracks, photographs, and documentation of expired licenses (Indian Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], 2015). AIS showed nine Chinese longline vessels fishing illegally for HMS during March and April 2015 (Glaser et al., 2015). Although the Chinese delegation recalled their vessels immediately, at least some of these vessels returned 2 months later with licenses issued by the Federal Government of Somalia. Recognizing the need for clear and comprehensive laws and regulations, fisheries ministers, policy makers, and international actors are working to improve and expand legislation around Somali fisheries. Inshore fisheries development is left to the discretion of federal member states (e.g., Puntland) and offshore fisheries are managed by the federal government in coordination with member states. Governance mechanisms that promote sustainable management with effective monitoring and enforcement of the Somali fisheries sector are needed to support long-term food, economic, and maritime security along Somalia’s 3,000 km coastline. However, governance of the Somali fisheries sector is wrought with challenges. One such challenge is the lack of continuity between federal and member state laws and policies. Somalia’s federal fisheries law is not mirrored in the regional member state laws, creating jurisdictional conflicts. This ambiguity has enabled states to disregard federal law in the past; for example, some states previously issued licenses to foreign vessels or permitted bottom trawling (which is clearly banned in the federal law). The federal government, in 2018, requested all prior-issued licenses be canceled, and federal member states complied. There are on-going efforts to rewrite the federal fishing law (adopted in 2014) and to update the constitution to make all state laws subordinate to the federal, but this is a lengthy process and requires Parliamentary approval. At one point, disagreement between member states and the federal government stalled progress toward effective fisheries governance. Since declaring the Somali EEZ in June 2014, policy makers have not created a federal fisheries authority to manage fishing. Meetings between fisheries ministers of the member states and the federal government between 2014 and 2017 helped build consensus on the role and responsibilities for management at each level of government. Agreements reached in April 2014, May 2016, and May 2017 specified that the federal government would have licensing jurisdiction over HMS in non-territorial waters. In 2018, a licensing agreement was finally adopted, but one issue to still resolve is how to divide revenues from that licensing. There are ongoing discussions over how to divide licensing fees between the state and federal governments. While fisheries experts support earmarking license revenue for building a federal fishing authority and investing in the Somali fishing sector, license revenue could also be used to support the security sector and economic development. These competing needs have stalled agreement on licensing modalities, which in turn delayed both the inflow of revenues and implementation of offshore fisheries management. Our research shows six nations were fishing in Somali waters in 2014, but before the peak of piracy, over 13 nations were actively fishing for HMS inside Somali boundaries. Today, many foreign fleets (particularly those from the EU) have expressed interest in acquiring fishing licenses if the Somali government develops a legitimate and reliable licensing scheme. In early 2019, the Federal Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources issued licenses to 31 Chinese longline vessels to fish for HMS in the Somali EEZ outside the 24 nm buffer reserved for Somali domestic fishers, earning $1 million in revenue for the government. The agreement resulted from successful negotiations between the federal government and member states, and it sets the stage for future negotiations on resource management. But the licensing of these vessels has been controversial within Somalia and public backlash has occurred over fears that foreign fishing vessels will outcompete or harm domestic fishers. In coastal communities, nearshore fisheries offer opportunities to build resiliency through food and economic security. Reliable access to food and stable food prices are a key component of such resiliency (McClanahan et al., 2015), which can reduce the likelihood that tensions turn into violence (Hendrix and Brinkman, 2013). If sustainably developed and managed for the long-term, fisheries can support stable and durable communities. Given a lack of long-term monitoring of Somali marine resources, there is considerable risk overexploitation will be undocumented until a tipping point has passed. At that point, artisanal fishers will be facing severe livelihood insecurity. Federal and state ministries lack the resources to build out management capacity in their own ministries, let alone in local communities. Lack of resources and funding is inadvertently creating a cycle of support for expanding foreign fishing operations in Somali waters while support for local communities lags far behind. Since 1991, Somalis have not had a viable way to manage the risks to their domestic fisheries. Illegal foreign fishing provided a form of moral justification for the rise of piracy to protect valuable marine resources. But piracy is not an inevitable reaction to foreign fishing. Conflict with foreign vessels can be reduced through reliable and explicit incentives for license agreements, sufficient resources, and political support for community-based solutions. Stability in Somalia is increasing while pirate attacks have declined significantly from their peak in the mid-2000s. Today, international donors and aid agencies are investing in coastal communities and artisanal fishing businesses. To succeed, these investments must promote sustainability while stabilizing the economy and promoting food security. Short-term investments without long-term planning or may result in overfishing and declining profits, ultimately exacerbating local frustration at international actors. Finally, these investments will fail if the international community and Somali authorities fail to reign in foreign illegal fishing in Somali waters.

                    Illegal Fishing as a Trans-National Crime
                ",2019-11-01
Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Google,Diving into the tuna ranching industry - ICIJ," Sea ""farms"", where bluefin are fattened to increase their value, have become centers for the bluefin black market in the Mediterranean and North Africa.  In the final days of 1996, the air was cold and seas rough around the southern Spanish port of Cartagena. A boat belonging to the Tuna Graso sea “ranch” — a joint venture between Japan’s Mitsui & Co. and Spain’s Ricardo Fuentes & Sons — had just pulled aboard a huge 300-kilo bluefin tuna from one of its underwater pens. That single fish was worth $17,000 to the company, and would fetch far more at auction in Tokyo.  The days of supplying fresh bluefin tuna just a few months a year were over. The introduction of fattening ranches, or farms, meant the Japanese could have high-quality bluefin for their sashimi year-round. Tuna captured at sea could now be transferred into cages and fattened for months in underwater coastal cages until Japanese buyers were ready to deal. That blustery day, the boat’s captain gave the order to return to dock. But in the choppy water, the big fish began to slide around the deck, thrashing violently. It injured crew members and endangered Japanese quality-control officers and Tuna Graso executives before falling overboard into the sea.   According to Pepe Amat, a former manager at Fuentes & Sons who witnessed the episode, these were the experimental years, when the goal was to perfect the methods for fishing, caging, harvesting, and trading bluefin tuna. No one had ever before attempted to commercialize giant bluefin fattened on farms, and accidents were bound to happen.  In the end, it was a minor setback to a method that would transform the industry over the next 15 years. Ranching the Eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna quickly became a multi-million dollar enterprise, with some 67 ranches spread across the Mediterranean. At the same time, the ranches would become the epicenter of an off-the-books trade that would decimate the region’s bluefin, until nearly 75 percent of the stock had disappeared.  In the closed culture of bluefin fishing, authorities, fishermen and ranchers can be as opaque as the waters on which they rely. They are part of a flawed system in which, for more than a decade, fishermen, ranchers, and traders engaged in widespread fraud and negligence, according to a seven-month inquiry by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The rampant rule-breaking gave rise to a black market in the prized tuna. At its peak, from 1998 to 2007, the illegal trade comprised more than one out of every three bluefin caught, at a market value of about $400 million annually, ICIJ found.   Cheating is particularly rife in the ranches’ murky waters, according to dozens of interviews with ranchers, fishermen, divers, traders, politicians, inspectors, and scientists. Among the illegal practices: underreporting numbers of bluefin caught, towed, caged, and sold; ranching of undersized fish; fake releases when forced by authorities to free already-illegally penned fish; under-declaring harvests and trading figures to comply on paper with legal quotas; and installing cages without permission. “Before the existence of the farms, the tuna market in the Mediterranean lasted only three months,” recounted a Spanish official who for years oversaw the industry. “The possibility of caging live bluefin gave rise to increased fishing capacity and over-catching.”   Intent on marketing the best quality bluefin back home, Japanese companies were the architects and financiers of the ranching industry. They partnered with Spanish and Croatian fishmongers to launch the innovative facilities. As the industry grew, and Mediterranean fishermen and ranchers engaged in a profitable gold rush, regulators turned a blind eye. The fate of Mediterranean bluefin rests with the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, an intergovernmental organization of 47 countries and the EU. ICCAT set the total allowable catch of bluefin at 13,500 metric tons this year, down from 22,000 in 2009. Yet the recorded capacity of the regions ranches is nearly five times the current quota, according to ICCAT, with many ranches located in loosely regulated countries such as Turkey and Tunisia.  So controversial are these ranches that the Japanese, who buy 80 percent of the world’s supply, are starting to balk at excesses in the industry. Last year, officials in Japan took the unprecedented step of blocking the entrance of more than frozen 3,500 tons of Atlantic bluefin — about one-sixth of the country’s annual imports. All of it came from Mediterranean ranches. Inspectors found some ranches were claiming to fatten tuna at levels that were biologically impossible, while others were exporting more fish to Japan than they had taken in. The Japanese eventually released all but 800 tons, but their point was clear. “If no set-up is in place for legally carrying out ranching, then it should be stopped for a while, and it should be cleaned up,” warned Masanori Miyahara, Japan’s senior delegate to ICCAT. Spurred by Japanese demand, the industry began to evolve rapidly in the 1990s. Big purse seining vessels — named for nets that close from below like a draw-string purse — could catch 3,000 tuna at a time. Selling them to ranches instead of directly to Japanese buyers increased their bottom line. “We were fishing a huge amount of bluefin, killing them at catch time, and selling it very cheap to the Japanese,” recounted Francisco Martínez, who pioneered ranching in the Mediterranean by opening a ranch in Spain in 1994. “Then, I went to Japan to study the market and realized that it was the moment to stop doing stupid things. It was the time to develop ranching in order to add value to that fishery.”   Ranching had proved successful in Australia, and the model was adapted to the Mediterranean. At sea, purse seiners transfer their catches to cages. A tugboat then tows them to ranches in coastal waters, at speeds of just two kilometers per hour, on journeys across the Mediterranean that can take a month. Once in these circular pens, the fish are fattened for months on sardine, mackerel, and herring until they obtain the fattiness, flavor and color that Japanese consumers demand. At “harvest,” the tuna are shot in the head and hauled aboard a vessel, to be gutted and their heads chain-sawed off. They are immediately dipped into a -2ºC seawater slush. Within hours most of the fish are deep-frozen onboard refrigerated vessels to be shipped to Japan. Others are packed, air freighted, and auctioned fresh in Japanese markets. Most of the bluefin at the ranches are adult fish. Scientists have been trying to raise Atlantic bluefin from larvae, but the migratory fish generally don’t survive more than a few weeks.  For years the ranching business boomed. Spanish ranchers dominated the business, first from Spain, and then through joint ventures with both local and Japanese partners in Croatia, Malta, Turkey, Italy, Tunisia, Cyprus, and Libya. Most of the fish were bought from Italian, French, and Spanish purse seine fleets.  The industry — and the EU — poured cash into modernizing the fleets, mainly the purse seiners and tugboats that supplied the ranches with live fish. But the investment created a vicious cycle, ranchers and officials say. Once the ship owners had purchased multimillion dollar vessels, they were forced to overfish to re-pay bank loans. As fishing grounds grew depleted, the fleets and ranches moved on from southern Europe to Tunisia and Libya in search of new sources of bluefin, industry veterans say. Starting in 2002, the once rich Balearic fishing ground off Spain “was about to collapse due to over-catching,” recalls Manel Balfegó, a fifth-generation Spanish tuna fisherman and co-owner of a ranching company.  “It was necessary to open ranches near the Libyan waters.”  Overfishing and the spread of ranches forced the bluefin population into a nose-dive, cutting it by nearly 75 percent over 40 years —more than half of that between 1997 and 2007, according to ICCAT figures. Some of the loss was due to liberal quotas, which ICCAT’s own scientists warned were too high. But much of it came from unreported and illegal catches, which accounted for up to half of all fish caught some years.  The structure of the ranches has made it easy to cover up the overcatch, ranching veterans say. Catches and transfers are carried out on open seas and with vessels and operators of multiple nationalities, each subject to different legislation. The ranches operate largely underwater and typically rely on divers’ estimates to document the numbers of fish brought in and sold. “I was a witness to the overfishing and overfarming,” said Emmanuel Delia, a professional diver for years with ranching companies in his native Malta. “There were no effective controls enforced on the bluefin industry before 2008.” A former manager for a prominent Mediterranean rancher blamed the off-the-books sales on underestimates of fish at the ranches. “Divers count the transfers of the bluefin tuna from the purse seiners to the towing cages, and from these to the fattening cages, with a guess,”  he explained. At slaughter, the rancher may realize that he owns more tuna than previously reported. “For the fish that are over quota, you have to find a solution” at the end of the season, said the former manager. Releasing the fish — and losing one’s investment — is simply not an option, he explained. A rancher has two choices: “You either trade it illegally or keep it until the next season… We took the over-quota fish to Tunisia.”  To combat the fraud and misreporting, ICCAT in 2008 implemented a reporting system called the Bluefin Tuna Catch Document Scheme (BCD), a program that the European Commission lauded as bringing “complete and reliable traceability” to the trade. Under the system, vessels are given a unique number for each catch. That number follows the catch to ranch, through harvest and finally to market. All along the supply chain, players are required to provide detailed information about the number, size, and location of the fish. The hand-written documents are validated by national fisheries authorities and submitted to ICCAT, where the data are manually entered into a database.  ICIJ gained access to the BCD database through an ICCAT member country, and its analysis found the system riddled with incomplete and contradictory information. Of the 4,102 entries for 2008 and 2009, 44 percent lack either a BCD number or other critical information related to vessel, catch, or destination. At least 96 records of shipments to Japan — equivalent to 5,000 tons — could not be traced back to a ranch or vessel in the database.  Perhaps that explains why Jean-Marc Fromentin, a member of ICCAT’s Scientific Committee, called the BCD database “a bloody mess.” BCD data related to ranches appear particularly problematic. At least 20 percent of the bluefin reported killed in ranches during those years — some 118,000 fish — lack trade information, effectively turning those fish into ghost tuna that regulators can’t track to their final destination. Perhaps most striking, the ranches appear to magically manufacture additional bluefin. More than a dozen Mediterranean ranches slaughtered more fish than they bought, according to the database. “This is incomprehensible, no matter which way you look at it,” commented ICCAT Japanese head Miyahara. “It is not as if the fish lay eggs and propagate while in the pen. We said this is nonsense.”  Among the ranches that have attracted the attention of authorities is Drvenik Tuna, co-owned by Ricardo Fuentes e Hijos (Ricardo Fuentes & Sons), the Mediterranean’s leading ranch company. Paco Fuentes, the company’s general manager for the last two decades, turned a humble family business into a powerful company through savvy deal-making. In the 1960s, his father sold salted fish door to door from a bicycle; now Fuentes flies across the Mediterranean in a private chartered jet.  In the early 1990s, the Japanese took notice of Paco while competing against him at bluefin auctions, and soon he was making deals with some of Japan’s top trading companies: Mitsui & Co. and, later, Mitsubishi Corporation and Maruha. In 1996, Fuentes & Sons opened a ranch in Spain, and since then the company has expanded its ranching activities to Croatia, Italy, Turkey, Malta, Cyprus, Libya, and Tunisia. In 2003, Fuentes, dubbed Paco-san by his Japanese partners, “boasted of having caught 16,000 tons of fish — 50 percent of all bluefin tuna fished in the Mediterranean,” according to a former manager at Fuentes & Sons. Today the company owns eight ranching subsidiaries in six countries. Paco-san shows little sympathy for those who warn the bluefin is in trouble. “There are a lot of small bluefin tunas in the Gulf of Lion waters” near France, he asserts. “It’s not true that the bluefin tuna stock is an endangered species.”  Fuentes jointly owns Drvenik Tuna, a Croatian ranch, with Japanese corporate giant Mitsubishi and local partner Conex Trade. Drvenik has drawn criticism from officials, NGOs and citizens since its founding in 1998. Among the complaints: building a ranch without appropriate authorization; and operating a vessel without valid documents, according to enforcement records and interviews. Environmentalists have also complained that the company polluted nearby waters by dumping fish remains.  In December 2008, Drvenik Tuna was forced to release 712 bluefins caught by French vessels after officials ruled the catch had been taken illegally, according to an ICCAT compliance report. A year later, Japanese officials refused entry of 560 tons of bluefin fattened at a Fuentes ranch in Tunisia because the Algerian-caught fish had no accompanying BCD, according to Tunisian government records. Again, Fuentes was ordered to release the fish. Drvenik is also the subject of a complaint filed by the city of Milna in southern Croatia, alleging that in 2006 a Drvenik subsidiary built a tuna ranch without proper authorization in Stipanska Bay, a pristine coastal area. A local NGO threatened to hire divers to cut open the cages, so no fish were ever brought to the ranch. A police investigation followed the complaint, and prosecutors told ICIJ they are now deciding whether to follow with a formal indictment regarding the allegedly improper construction. Fuentes managers at its Cartagena, Spain, headquarters responded that there were some issues with Drvenik in the past, but referred ICIJ to Mladen Milakovic, their Croatian partner and manager. Milakovic declined to comment. Mitsubishi said Drvenik has not received “any official letter or document” from Croatian officials regarding the complaint and is “in full compliance with local and ICCAT regulations.”   The company’s troubles are not limited to Tunisia and Croatia. In late 2008 a government inspection of Caladeros del Mediterraneo, a Fuentes & Sons company in Spain, found that the ranch had fattened more tuna than it declared, and was told to release the fish. David Martínez, Fuentes assistant manager, said the problem was not that they didn’t declare fish, but that their legal fish had gained too much weight. Fuentes & Sons is not the only rancher to attract controversy. The tiny island of Malta, 90 kilometers from Sicily, has built up the Mediterranean’s largest bluefin ranching capacity in the last five years, and in 2007 alone processed 11,360 tons of the fish — nearly 40 percent of ICCAT’s entire quota for that year.  In 2007, journalist Raphael Vassallo with Malta Today began writing about the local ranchers, pointing out alleged shortcomings in import-export data, fattening rates that appeared biologically impossible, and an illegal case of re-flagging vessels. Vassallo and his newspaper were later hit with what he calls “a mass libel legal action by all five companies” on the island — Ta'Mattew Fish Farms, Fish & Fish Tuna Ranch, Malta Fish Farms, AJD Tuna, and Mare Blu Tuna Ranch. The companies blamed Vassallo for financial losses stemming from his “libelous” and “defamatory” allegations, the reporter says. “The situation as it stands today is that all charges against me personally have been dropped,” Vassallo told ICIJ, “but the cases against the newspaper have been retained… presumably, for as long as it takes to stop us from reporting the issue.”  Others are raising questions about bluefin from Malta’s ranches. When Japanese inspectors last year blocked the import of more than 3,500 tons of bluefin, much of the supply came from Maltese ranches. The amount constituted “most of the tuna farmed in Malta, the equivalent to €40 million,” according to Malta Director of Fisheries Control Andreina Fenech. The Japanese are still blocking €8 million worth of Maltese bluefin. “The last months have been very tough for the Maltese ranchers,” Fenech added.  ICIJ’s analysis of BCD data suggests why Japanese inspectors may have raised questions about bluefin from Mediterranean ranches. More than a dozen ranches appear to have harvested more fish than they reported transferring into their cages. For example, in May 2008, a Turkish vessel reported catching 580 tuna, and transferring those fish into cages belonging to Sagun, a leading ranch in Turkey. But when Sagun reported the harvest of those fish five months later, the BCD data show that it pulled out 2,866 fish —nearly five times the number that went in.   “Our company has been acting in accordance with international and national regulations,” Sagun wrote in response to ICIJ’s request for comment. “The allegations of wrongdoing have nothing to do with our firm.”  Mediterranean ranchers have seen better days. Although criticized as too high by some scientists, an ICCAT quota of 13,500 tons for 2010 has forced the ranchers to cut back on production, they say. Industry sources estimate this year will bring in revenues of some $310 million, down from $490 million in 2008. Fuentes Group managers say that of the company’s eight ranching subsidiaries, only three are operating.  In Brussels, meanwhile, a new EU Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries — Greece’s Maria Damanaki — is threatening “to close the fishery if there is no compliance.” The ranchers see Damanaki as an avid environmentalist — “green as a bottle of Heineken,” as one manager put it.  Even the Japanese, after helping finance and set up the ranching industry, are having second thoughts. By 2008, criticism from environmentalists and warnings from scientists about plummeting bluefin stocks were starting to have an impact, prompting a public pledge by top buyer Mitsubishi to support a sustainable fishery. To show they were serious, last year Japanese officials made their first big refusals of bluefin imports, citing dubious paperwork by suppliers. At the end of 2009, ICIJ has learned, Tokyo temporarily halted imports from Tunisia after, among other problems, ranches there reported harvesting more fish than they took in.  If Japanese officials needed further convincing of the need for a crackdown, it came last March, when their delegates had to marshal forces to block an international attempt — sponsored by Monaco and backed by the EU and US — to ban Atlantic bluefin trade by listing it under CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Now Japan’s chief ICCAT delegate Miyahara, in a September interview with ICIJ, has warned that his country will consider supporting a temporary shut down of the ranches. Not everyone is sympathetic to Japan’s new-found rigor. “The Japanese are the designers and financiers of the Mediterranean farming system,” said Sergi Tudela, head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean. “They wanted the fatty fish and they recruited the people who could carry out this work for them. Now that the system is out of control and markets are saturated, they are scrambling to distance themselves from it.” How far Japanese officials will go remains to be seen. Demand for the prized bluefin will be hard to dampen in the markets and sushi bars of Tokyo and Osaka, and Japan remains by far the world’s biggest buyer. Despite concern by some ranchers, few believe the Japanese will support a moratorium on bluefin fishing when ICCAT holds its annual meeting this month. “Japan has the last word on the ICCAT decisions,” said a confident Negi Toumi, general manager of Tuna Farms of Tunisia. “The Japanese want to go ahead with their trading strategy — and that is a guarantee for us.” Be the first to know when we publish.

Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Bing,Tuna fishery works to reduce bycatch," How the island nation of Fiji is leading the way in reducing accidental catch in longline tuna fisheries. When the fishery prepared for its first MSC assessment in 2011, it had a problem with shark bycatch. The fishery immediately started work to reduce its impact on various species of sharks.  Parts of fishing lines called ‘traces’ are commonly made of wire to prevent fish biting through the line. Unfortunately, sharks are more likely to get accidently caught when fishers use these traces. To tackle the problem, the fishery switched to monofilament traces, which sharks can bite through to escape. The fishery also committed to improve the information on bycatch by requiring vessels to complete log sheets of all interactions with sharks. Vessels now fish in deeper waters, where they are less likely to encounter some shark species. The fishery also use circle hooks on their lines. Circle hooks have been shown to reduce accidental catch of other species such as sea turtles.  The presence of independent observers on fishing vessels is an important part in good fisheries management. Observers record catch and bycatch. Since gaining MSC certification in 2012, the fishery has substantially increased its levels of observer coverage. In 2017, observers participated in 62% of trips by the fishery's MSC certified vessels. The fishery is also using electronic monitoring systems and has installed onboard cameras on 50 vessels. The Fiji Maritime Academy has introduced a training module on bycatch mitigation as part of the Deckhand Fishing and Offshore Skipper Programme. In April 2019, the first students graduated and are now gaining practical at-sea work experience on-board fishing vessels.  Recent graduates from the Fiji Maritime Academy who are trained in bycatch mitigation on longline vessels. Fiji National University (FNU) North East Arctic cod and haddock thrive in the Barents Sea due to good management and international collaboration.  A Chilean squat lobster fishery has been working with researchers to map its fishing grounds and better understand its impacts on deep sea habitats and ecosystems. The Oregon and Washington pink shrimp fishery off the west coast of the USA is working to protect a lesser-known fish.  MSC certified fisheries are continually improving to minimise environmental impacts. Share This '{{item.Image.Title}}', {{item.Image.Artist}}, {{item.Image.Description}}",2022-09-16
Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Bing,Where did your can of tuna come from?," WWF works to sustain the natural world for the benefit of people and wildlife, collaborating with partners from local to global levels in nearly 100 countries. Stories & updates World Wildlife Magazine Newsroom   (Click images or icons to progress) Skipjack—the smallest, most common species of tuna—travel in large schools through the Western Central Pacific Ocean.
 Most skipjack is caught by purse seine fishing: A ship unfurls a cylindrical net around a school of fish, closes the net from the bottom, and pulls it to the surface.
 The fishing vessel carries its tuna catch to a port at Kiribati, where it transfers the catch to a larger, refrigerated carrier vessel.
 The carrier vessel transports the catch to Thailand, one of the world's biggest tuna processing countries (Thailand exports 40% of the world's canned tuna supply).
 While much of the tuna flowing into Thailand gets canned there, US-bound tuna tends to be converted from frozen fish to loins (the meat used in canned tuna), refrozen, and packed into another carrier ship.
 The frozen loins then travel from Bangkok to a cannery in the US. There, the meat is divided into cans, which are then sealed, cooked, cooled, labeled, and checked for quality. In 2015, the US imported more than 115,000 tons of tuna (worth $540 million) from Thailand).The finished product—canned light meat tuna—is trucked to a distribution center in Southern California. From there, it's sent to grocery stores across the US.   WWF is working along multiple steps of the tuna supply chain to make it more sustainable. In 2008, we helped launch the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation to improve the tuna fisheries management process through advocacy and voluntary implementation of best practices. We're also working with purse seine fleets engaging in fishery improvement projects in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans; supporting the creation of sustainable tuna fisheries that benefit local communities and use new technology to improve monitoring practices; and helping major seafood buyers understand the importance of sourcing their fish from fisheries that have sustainability certification through the Marine Stewardship Council.

Deckhand Tuna Boats make nd $46,177, with the top 83% making $53,142. Yellowfin, bigeye, bluefin, albacore, and skipjack tuna are among the commercially valuable species. It is extremely hard to predict how much money you'll make from tuna fishing due to its unpredictable nature. A tuna fisherman typically earns a base salary plus a percentage of his catch's profits. It can vary depending on where you fish along the coast, the size of the tuna boat, whether you're fishing inshore or offshore, the time of year, and the captain's skill. There are several factors that can affect how much you can earn. You could earn anywhere between $10,000 and $100,000 a year. Deckhand Tuna Boats make nd $46,177, with the top 83% making $53,142.

Ott and I Tuna fishing can be started with an inflatable boat of this size for less than $20,000. Some used tuna fishing boats can sell for half a million dollars if they are used for commercial fishing. In the 2019 market, rewards were at record lows. The most common price per pound was $4. Fishermen were paid $7 per pound the previous year. 1980s saw bluefin tuna prices often around or above $15 per pound as a result of the free-falling international economy. All bluefin tuna that is caught for commercial purposes can only be sold to fish dealers licensed by law. NOAA Fisheries and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regulate this market. The cast of ""Wicked Tuna"" makes about $10,000 per episode, according to an article from Looper. Additionally, you'll be earning revenue from the tuna you catch. It is evident that Outsiders want to find out who makes the most money on National Geographic. A captain does. $3 million in a deal that went down in history. 1m (£2. As a result, the tuna became the world's most expensive at a first-ever auction in Tokyo's new fish market, where Kiyoshi Kimura bought the 278 kg (612 pounds) bluefin tuna, an endangered species that competes for scarce resources. Take a look at an example of a day of tuna fishing at sea, and see how much it would cost you to run it. Around $18,000 might be the price of a used small tuna boat. Around $5,000 will be spent on radar systems, GPS, and boat electronics. About $5,000 will be spent on trolling tackle. Several methods are available for catching tuna, including purse seining, long lines, and pole and line. Because tuna fishing is unpredictable, the income from this occupation can be highly variable. A tuna fisherman typically earns a base salary plus a percentage of his catch's profits. Cast members of Wicked Tuna make an impressive amount of money per episode, reportedly $100,000.

 Kenya has stepped up measures to increase production of tuna fish along its Indian Ocean coast.
The country is looking to raise exports of the sea fish that it mostly sells in European markets.






Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri said the country had recently submitted a fishing fleet development plan to the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC).
He said the country would soon flag off vessels that would enable Kenyans to harvest the fish species from its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which stretches 200 nautical miles.

Speaking at the ongoing Blue Economy Conference, the CS said within the Indian Ocean fisheries management framework under the IOTC, Kenya was allocated a fishing capacity of 72 deep sea fishing vessels.  
Over the past two years, Kenyan fishing industry has been shrinking in value even as more imports hit the country’s market.






Kenya, which is hosting a global conference on water resources, saw fish value to the economy decline from 0.7 per cent in 2014 to 0.4 per cent last year.
State data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics also show that value of fishing and aquaculture dipped from Sh40 billion in 2015 to Sh36 billion last year.
President Kenyatta has been previously quoted saying that of the global tuna catch of 4.35 million metric tonnes annually, 25 per cent is fished off Kenya's coast.
Kiunjuri added that the Government was also promoting the private sector to develop domestic fishing fleet aimed at tuna fishing and was also facilitating their licensing.
“The Government is promoting the private sector to develop the domestic fishing fleet targeting tuna and tuna-like fishery by allocating the fishing access rights, facilitating joint venture and licensing,” he said.



  
He said tuna fish would help sustain local demand and also provide raw materials for manufacturing and fish processing industries.
Kiunjuri said that, together with the recently operationalised Liwatoni Fishing Complex that handles landed fish, the Government's efforts are aimed at creating employment and wealth generation.  Stay informed. Subscribe to our newsletter

“To actualise the objective of the blue economy through the fisheries component, it requires deliberate, sustained and visible investment on development of sea going capacity, post-harvest handling infrastructure and management technology for its success,” he said.
He said the country was focused on revitalising the blue economy, particularly through utilisation of Kenya’s EEZ.
“This will be through operationalisation of the Kenya Fisheries Advisory Council, developing Kenya National Fishing fleet, strengthening of monitoring, control and surveillance systems to provide efficient and effective fisheries governance, developing fisheries-related infrastructure like ice plants and construction of fish ports as envisaged in Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties,” he said.
He added the ministry was also strengthening and involving fisher communities through Beach Management Units in co-management of the fishing sector.
Kiunjuri was speaking at a side event dubbed 'The role of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in ending hunger and securing food supply to promote good health and create wealth'.
He, however, warned that illegal fishing and other unsustainable marine habits were taking a toll on the world’s oceans.
Unregulated fishing
“Unfortunately, anthropogenic activities including overexploitation, illegal unreported and unregulated fishing, destructive fishing, as well as unsustainable aquaculture practices, marine pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of alien species, climate change and ocean acidification are taking a toll on the world’s oceans and seas,” he said.
He said Kenya was committed to facilitating sustainable management of the EEZ resources as well as supporting efforts towards sustainable management of marine resources in the high seas for the present and future generations.

“To actualise the objective of the blue economy through the fisheries component, it requires deliberate, sustained and visible investment on development of sea going capacity, post-harvest handling infrastructure and management technology for its success,” he said.
He said the country was focused on revitalising the blue economy, particularly through utilisation of Kenya’s EEZ.
“This will be through operationalisation of the Kenya Fisheries Advisory Council, developing Kenya National Fishing fleet, strengthening of monitoring, control and surveillance systems to provide efficient and effective fisheries governance, developing fisheries-related infrastructure like ice plants and construction of fish ports as envisaged in Mombasa, Kilifi and Kwale counties,” he said.
He added the ministry was also strengthening and involving fisher communities through Beach Management Units in co-management of the fishing sector.
Kiunjuri was speaking at a side event dubbed 'The role of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture in ending hunger and securing food supply to promote good health and create wealth'.
He, however, warned that illegal fishing and other unsustainable marine habits were taking a toll on the world’s oceans.
Unregulated fishing
“Unfortunately, anthropogenic activities including overexploitation, illegal unreported and unregulated fishing, destructive fishing, as well as unsustainable aquaculture practices, marine pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of alien species, climate change and ocean acidification are taking a toll on the world’s oceans and seas,” he said.
He said Kenya was committed to facilitating sustainable management of the EEZ resources as well as supporting efforts towards sustainable management of marine resources in the high seas for the present and future generations.
 
 Speaking at the ongoing Blue Economy Conference, the CS said within the Indian Ocean fisheries management framework under the IOTC, Kenya was allocated a fishing capacity of 72 deep sea fishing vessels.  
Over the past two years, Kenyan fishing industry has been shrinking in value even as more imports hit the country’s market.






Kenya, which is hosting a global conference on water resources, saw fish value to the economy decline from 0.7 per cent in 2014 to 0.4 per cent last year.
State data from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics also show that value of fishing and aquaculture dipped from Sh40 billion in 2015 to Sh36 billion last year.
President Kenyatta has been previously quoted saying that of the global tuna catch of 4.35 million metric tonnes annually, 25 per cent is fished off Kenya's coast.
Kiunjuri added that the Government was also promoting the private sector to develop domestic fishing fleet aimed at tuna fishing and was also facilitating their licensing.

Vessel caught misreporting tuna catch quantities,Bing,How to Catch Giant Tuna in Five Different Regions," Head south to tangle with blackfins off the Florida coast. April and May are prime months for catching big blackfin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus) off South Florida and the Keys, with numerous fish in the 20-plus-pound class.  Off Miami, big blackfins engulf goggle-eyes, pilchards, herring, pinfish and other live baits dangling from fishing kites, especially those positioned between 50 and 150 feet deep. These blackfins mix with the spring run of sailfish, favoring color changes, rips, wrecks and reefs between 90 and 300 feet. Spinning and conventional reels with 20-pound-mono main lines are perfect here. The humps and bars off the Florida Keys are rich with blackfins. Power-drifting along their up-current sides and live-chumming with pilchards score fast limits. However, drifting across the humps with a live pinfish or a fresh squid, one positioned around 50 to 80 feet deep, and one between 150 and 200 feet down, will yield some of the bigger specimens. Don’t overgun terminal tackle; keep with 30- and 40-pound fluorocarbon leaders and small inline circle hooks, 2/0 to 4/0, based on bait size. The easiest way to score blackfins at the humps and on deep wrecks is by trolling swimming plugs the likes of a Rapala CD Mag 14. Rig these with 30-pound fluorocarbon leader and troll parallel to their up-current sides around 10 mph. Marking blackfins on the sonar and jigging with flutter-style irons rigged with 30-pound fluorocarbon leaders is another simple means of catching them. Key West offers access to shrimp boats in the Gulf. In April and May, big blackfins forage on the bycatch culled from shrimpers. Super-early morning starts are a must, and long hauls often the norm. However, if you find a shrimper dumping bycatch, there should be blackfins and bonito in feeding frenzies. Broadcast a scoop of shrimp-boat bycatch, followed by a hook bait of the same. Frenzied blackfins can even be fooled on top with topwater plugs and flies matched to the size and colors of the bycatch. Light spin tackle with 12- or 20-pound line is perfect for casting and getting the most fun out of fighting these fish. As for other periods, blackfins are on the Florida Keys humps throughout summer, though not as consistently as during the spring and fall. They’re caught incidentally when live-baiting or trolling around deep wrecks and bars, more so by jigging these structures around sunrise. However, come October and November, they’ll begin returning in numbers to the humps, bars and wrecks throughout the Florida Keys, just in time to please the tourists. —George Poveromo These deepwater creatures of the canyons will test your mettle.  In the world of hard-charging gamefish, the bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) has few peers. Growing to more than 300 pounds, fighting one can be a knock-down, drag-out fight that will stress tackle and test your stamina. Bigeyes visit the canyons from southern New England to the mid-Atlantic yearly, usually arriving in May and staying well into the fall. Their feeding patterns can change during the season, but one major food source remains the same—Illex illecebrosus, northern shortfin squid.  Bigeyes have more in common with swordfish than other tuna. Shared traits include excellent low-light vision, the ability to augment their body temperature when feeding in the cold water of the deep, and a vertical lifestyle that keys around the movements of the squid they predate upon. Bigeyes will make more frequent trips to the surface than their billed companion. When they are near the surface, they will also feed on a variety of forage fish. That’s when anglers target them. Squid exhibit a daily migration, going deep during daylight hours and then shallow as darkness approaches, often holding near the surface throughout the night—and bigeyes will be hot on their tails. Eyeballs, as they are sometimes called, usually attack in wolf packs, which means multiple hookups are common when trolling. The most productive hours for trolling occur early in the morning—starting well before first light—and again as the sun sets.  A mixed pattern of spreader bars and rigged ballyhoo under heavy Joe Shutes-style skirts is a top choice when targeting bigeyes. Running weighted dredges can attract bigeyes into your pattern, even if they are holding 100 or more feet down. Keep your trolling baits and lures well below the surface, and stick with dark colors for skirts over ballyhoo, lures and bars early and late in the day.  According to Capt. Mark DeBlasio, a renowned bigeye specialist, evening bites are often the best as hungry bigeyes follow the squid to the surface. He recommends trolling well after dark using weighted naked and skirted large ballyhoo. Glow lures are not recommended because the bigeye’s excellent low-light vision allows them to see your presentation without artificial enhancement.  If you encounter squid near the surface while night chunking, catch and live-line some, as they will take both bigeye and yellowfin. Be sure to fish deep lines above and below the thermocline for swordfish too. —Gary Caputi Read Next: Popping for Tuna The Gulf of Mexico offers a bounty of tuna species, including yellowfin, blackfin and bigeye.  From Key West to South Padre, there’s ample options for tuna in the expansive Gulf of Mexico. Skipjack and blackfins are accessible closer to shore, while migratory giant bluefins routinely wreck heavy tackle aboard boats trolling the Stream. But for nearly year-round offshore action, yellowfins (Thunnus albacares) and occasionally bigeyes share the spotlight, especially during the summer tournament season. The Midnight Lump, a salt dome about 40 miles southwest off Louisiana’s coast, offers shots at hefty yellowfins during winter and early spring. Rising to within 200 feet of the surface, the lump is a baitfish magnet. Chunking and live-baiting are the favored tactics here. As the water warms and offshore rips and eddies form, soaking bridled skipjack, blue runners and other baits on marlin tackle produces prize-winning catches. The top zones center around the numerous energy rigs and floating drill platforms in the central and western Gulf. Underwater lights at night attract flying fish, which can be netted and redeployed for almost-certain hookups. The autumn shrimp run is the perfect time to chunk behind the trawlers as tuna scarf up the discarded bycatch. For a faster pace, tossing large poppers on heavy spin tackle to busting schools of flying fish in open water will definitely ramp up the adrenalin.  Tuna hunters in the Florida Panhandle also enjoy consistent success. The FAD system off Destin, the Spur and the pipeline area in 700- to 800-foot depths are good places to target. Capt. Adam Peeples (one​shotcharters.com) routinely puts his clients on chunky yellowfin and bigeye tuna. “It all depends on the water temperatures,” Peeples explains. “Once it drops to 70 and below, the fish fade off. But day in, day out, live bait is the key as long as it’s in good shape and frisky.” —Capt. Dave Lear If you want to experience pacific longfin action, you best head north. Pacific albacore (Thunnus alalonga) had at one time sustained the sport-fishing fleet in San Diego. But for more than 20 years of offshore summer seasons, the northward-migrating longfin tuna have bypassed the waters off SoCal. To catch albies now, head to the tempestuous waters off northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Varying from 5-pounders to 50-pound-class fish, albacore prove eager biters, spirited fighters and fine table fare. These white-meat tuna are the coveted chicken of the sea.  Albacore haunt purple-blue water and temperature breaks—changes of 2 to 5 degrees along which they can find and gorge on forage species, such as anchovies and sauries. Breaks often occur along the continental shelf, submerged canyons, ridges and seamounts. Some key ports to launch an albie hunt in California include Morro Bay, Santa Cruz, Bodega Bay and Crescent City. In Oregon, albie hotspots include Coos Bay and Garibaldi. In Washington state, many albacore trips originate in Westport. On Vancouver Island, the village of Kyuquot serves many of Canada’s longfin aficionados. Albacore like water temperatures from 59 to 62 degrees F, which can occur anywhere along the coast between June and October. While some anglers prospect, many wait until a concentration of albies is located before committing to a trip as far as 60 miles offshore, and only when calm weather conditions permit.  Traditionally, anglers troll feather jigs, cedar plugs and large deep-diving lures at about 7 knots to find albacore, in addition to searching for birds, jumping bait, temperature breaks and sometimes leaping albacore. When a fish is hooked, the school often follows it to the boat, where anglers catch fish with live bait such as sardines. Tossing out live baits helps keep the school around the vessel. In areas where no live bait is available, anglers continue to troll to catch fish. —Jim Hendricks From northern waters to North Carolina, anglers anxiously await the arrival of bluefins. Atlantic bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus, can be found along the Eastern Seaboard from Nova Scotia to the Gulf of Mexico, give or take. With a long life span of 20 years or more, they can grow up to 2,000 pounds. This, and their excellence as table fare, makes them an important commercial and recreation fish, with die-hard anglers chasing giants using a variety of methods.  You can expect bluefins to make a showing off New England around June and stick around through December or later, depending on water temperature. They move southward through their range as winter progresses, showing up rather predictably off the North Carolina coast in November. By late winter and early spring, the tuna move to the edge of the Gulf Stream off Cape Hatteras. The most common way to target bluefin tuna is trolling large ballyhoo under a heavy skirt at 3 to 4 knots, typically with 80- and 130-pound rods. The trick is to drop the lures up to 100 yards behind the boat. Slow-troll the spread through schools of menhaden and sand eels found anywhere from the beach to 20 miles out. Anglers also chase giant bluefins with topwater plugs and vertical jigs. To locate tuna, watch the fish-finder screen for bluefin marks and search the surface of the water for tuna foaming on bait. Favored jigs are the Hogy Harness Jig, Shimano Ocea Sardine Waver and Nomad Design Streaker. Top topwaters include the Shimano Ocea Bomb Dip Flash Boost, Yo-Zuri Mag Popper and Nomad Chug Norris. But be careful what you wish for because battling a bluefin on a spinner can be a test of endurance. Luckily, bluefin tuna have a low rate of release mortality. In fact, strict regulations inspire most recreational anglers to release giant bluefins. For me, bringing a quarter-ton bluefin boatside, controlling it with the leader, and retrieving the lure before releasing the giant to swim back into the deep is even more enjoyable than fresh sashimi and poke bowls. —Ric Burnley",2024-06-03

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Google,"Toolkit: How to Investigate Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing"," Thai naval officers conducting a raid on a fishing vessel suspected of illegal fishing. Image: Shutterstock Editor’s Note: This toolkit was originally published by the Pulitzer Center and is republished here with permission. It is estimated that one in five fish caught comes from illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing practices. The issue, which accounts for 20% of the global seafood catch, annually costs the economy US$23 billion. The problem does not only have a financial impact. Marine ecosystems, coastal communities, food security, and human rights are on the line. And IUU fishing is hard to combat because jurisdiction in the ocean is a complex issue. International treaties state that each country’s national jurisdiction extends 200 nautical miles off their coast: an area called Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Beyond their EEZ, countries have no authority to apply their laws or regulations. Still, many initiatives try to mitigate IUU fishing such as a UN agreement that aims to conserve and incentivize sustainable use of Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (also known as the BBNJ or high seas treaty) and the Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability (GDST). To support journalists covering IUU fishing and its consequences, the Ocean Reporting Network (ORN) has created this toolkit and hosted a webinar on Tuesday, June 11, 2024. Many activities fall under the umbrella of IUU fishing, here are some examples: The list can go on, but it’s important to keep in mind that any fishing activity that violates regional, national, or international legislation or undermines fisheries management authorities can be considered IUU fishing. Journalists must also note that legal fishing has the potential to collapse fisheries and threaten species, especially when local legislation sets quotas too high or when there is not a transparent dialogue between coastal communities and policy markers. To tackle IUU fishing, various monitoring, control, and surveillance efforts are underway. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), responsible for safe international shipping, requires ships of a certain size to carry an Automatic Identification System (AIS) device. The AIS indicates the ship’s course, position, speed, and other relevant information. The device should be on and broadcasting at all times, regardless of location, fishing activity or flag, unless there is a valid reason like the threat of an attack to turn it off. However, it is common for vessels to break this rule and turn off their device to hide the fact that they are fishing where they should not. Using tools such as Global Fishing Watch and MarineTraffic, it can be possible to study ships’ movements to detect transshipment, fishing methods, and ports of call. Governments often fail to monitor and control their fish stocks efficiently because they lack the resources and information to do so. A good tip for journalists is to investigate the regulatory body responsible for fisheries in their countries. Who is responsible for the ministry? What laws or regulations are they proposing and passing? How transparent are they with the data offered to citizens? One major lead journalists can pursue concerns whether a vessel is in compliance with fishing regulation. There are many storylines to explore: From legal frameworks, to data collection and analysis, academics and consultants have assessed regional levels of IUU fishing and estimated global losses. In this section, we highlight some of the leading scholars dedicated to IUU fishing, separated by region and based on publications that have inspired our own research. Asia  Africa Americas  Antarctica Europe Oceania There are platforms and technologies that provide journalists with tools to uncover, document, and report on IUU fishing activities, contributing to greater transparency and accountability in global fisheries management.

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Google,"Report on IUU Fishing, Bycatch, and Shark Catch"," Internet Explorer lacks support for the features of this website. For the best experience, please use a modern browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. NOAA Fisheries' biennial report to Congress identifies nations and entities that the United States will work with to address IUU fishing and forced labor activities, and to support effective management of protected species and shark catch. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing is a serious global problem that threatens ocean ecosystems and sustainable fisheries critical to global food and economic security – putting law-abiding fishermen and seafood producers in the United States and abroad at a disadvantage. Bycatch can negatively affect the conservation of protected marine life. Nations that do not have regulatory programs in place to effectively reduce or mitigate bycatch of protected species caught in association with fisheries threaten the sustainability of those ecosystems or other transboundary resources shared with the United States. There are also growing concerns regarding the status of many shark stocks and their exploitation in global fisheries.  In biennial reports to Congress, NOAA Fisheries identifies nations and entities that the United States will work with over the next two years to address IUU fishing and forced labor activities, and support effective management of protected species and shark catch. In the following report, certification determinations – a determination on whether actions were taken to remedy the identified activities -- are announced for the previously identified nations. A negative certification may result in denial of U.S. port access for fishing vessels of that nation and potential import restrictions on fish or fish products. In its 2023 Report, NOAA Fisheries identified seven nations and entities for IUU fishing: Identifications for the PRC and Taiwan include information related to seafood-related goods produced through forced labor. The PRC and Vanuatu are additionally identified for shark catch without a regulatory program comparable to that of the United States. This is the first time, as part of this report, that NOAA Fisheries identified nations for shark catch, and considered forced labor in the seafood sector when making IUU fishing identifications. The 2023 Report also announced certification determinations for thirty-one nations and entities identified for IUU fishing and/or bycatch of protected marine life from its 2021 Report. IUU Fishing  Protected Marine Life Bycatch Additionally, Mexico has been negatively certified for its lack of a comparable regulatory program to reduce or minimize bycatch of endangered North Pacific loggerhead sea turtles.  NOAA Fisheries will work with nations and entities to address the identified activities – which helps ensure that the fish and fish products the United States imports are caught sustainably and legally. In the 2021 Report, seven nations and entities were identified for having vessels engaged in IUU fishing activities during 2018–2020: The following countries were identified for lacking a regulatory program comparable to that of the United States to reduce the bycatch of protected marine life in their fishing operations: Ecuador and the Republic of Korea received positive certification determinations for taking actions to remedy the IUU fishing activities for which they were identified in the 2019 Report. Mexico received a negative certification for IUU fishing activities identified in 2019, which were failing to curb the flow of small vessels fishing illegally in the U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Failure to remedy these incursions into U.S. waters led to Mexico’s negative certification. As a result, port restrictions on all Mexican fishing vessels that fish in the Gulf of Mexico were enacted. Effective February 7, 2022, these vessels are prohibited from entering U.S. ports and will be denied port access and services. Three nations (Mexico, Ecuador, and the Russian Federation) that were identified in the 2017 Report for reported IUU fishing activities have since taken actions to remedy those activities. This has resulted in a positive certification decision for each nation from the United States. However, Mexico and Ecuador were again identified for reported IUU fishing activities (occurring in 2016–2018). The Republic of Korea was identified for reported IUU fishing activities.           In its 2017 Report, three nations were identified—Ecuador, Mexico, and the Russian Federation for having vessels engaged in IUU fishing activities.   Additionally, NOAA Fisheries positively certified that five of the six nations identified in the 2015 Report took corrective action with respect to the offending activities. Mexico did not and was negatively certified. In April 2018, an Addendum to the 2017 Biennial Report to Congress was issued: As Mexico was also identified for additional cases of IUU fishing in the 2017 Report, failure to sustain its efforts to combat IUU fishing could result in another negative certification in the 2019 Report to Congress. In its 2015 report, six nations were identified—Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Portugal—for having vessels engaged in IUU fishing activities.  After consultations with NOAA, the ten nations previously identified in the 2013 Report each took corrective action with respect to the cited offending activities and were positively certified.  In its 2013 Report, NOAA identified ten nations as having vessels engaged in IUU fishing during the preceding 2 years: Colombia, Ecuador, Ghana, Italy, Korea (Republic of), Mexico, Panama, Spain, Tanzania, and Venezuela.   The United States successfully worked with the six nations previously identified in the 2011 Report, and each took corrective action with respect to the cited offending activities and each was positively certified.  In its 2011 Report, NOAA identified six nations as having vessels engaged in IUU fishing during the preceding two years: Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Panama, Portugal, and Venezuela. The six nations previously identified in the 2009 Report each took corrective action with respect to the cited offending activities and were positively certified.  In its inaugural report, six nations were identified for having vessels engaged in IUU fishing activities: France, Italy, Libya, Panama, the People’s Republic of China, and Tunisia.   The National Defense Authorization Act (2023) made a number of procedural and substantive amendments to the Moratorium Protection Act.  Among those were provisions enabling NOAA Fisheries to identify nations and entities at any time the agency has sufficient information and allowing NOAA Fisheries to consider forced labor and child labor in preparing its IUU fishing identifications. The Shark/IUU Fishing Final Rule (2013) implemented the international provisions of the Shark Conservation Act. This regulation specifies procedures for identifying and certifying nations whose vessels target sharks on the high seas. It also amends the definition of IUU fishing to help ensure a comprehensive approach to addressing unsustainable fisheries activities of greatest concern to the United States. The IUU Fishing/Bycatch Final Rule (2011) established procedures for the identification and certification of nations whose vessels are engaged in IUU fishing or bycatch of protected living marine resources.

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Google,Operation Albacore — Sea Shepherd Conservation Society," In April 2016, Sea Shepherd began a partnership with the government of Gabon to stop illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing in their coastal waters. In August 2016, the campaign expanded to include the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe. Of the global catch of fish, 15-40% is estimated to be caught by illegal operators, and 90% is caught in waters that fall under the authority of a Coastal State like Gabon. Gabon is a hotspot for a marine wildlife, including the largest breeding population of leatherback and olive ridley sea turtles, 20 species of dolphins and whales, and some of the world’s richest tuna waters. It is also a humpback whale breeding ground and nursery. Despite laws and political will to protect the waters, Gabon lacks the adequate resources to do so.  During the 110-day chase of the infamous poaching vessel the Thunder, Gabon expressed a willingness to help intercede and arrest the ship if possible. Due to that connection and the government’s commitment to stopping ocean crime, Sea Shepherd and the government of Gabon arranged to have one of our vessels patrol their waters. From April-September 2016, the M/V Bob Barker patrolled Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe’s coastlines as a civilian patrol vessel, with Sea Shepherd crew under the direction of Campaign Leader Captain Peter Hammarstedt, Gabonese Navy officers, and officers with the Fisheries Enforcement Agency. During this time, over 40 inspections and boardings were carried out at sea, resulting in the arrest of five IUU fishing vessels, including one discovered trawling inside Mayumba National Park, a marine protected area. In 2017, following the announcement of the creation of 9 new national marine parks and 11 new aquatic reserves in West Africa, Sea Shepherd returned to Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe. During the four-month campaign, officers from the Gabonese Navy and Fisheries Enforcement Agency and Sea Shepherd crewmembers were stationed on board the M/V Bob Barker. Admiral Giuseppe de Giorgi, the former Chief of the Italian Navy, also crewed. Operation Albacore II resulted in the arrest of two fishing vessels, who were found to be fishing without a license. The campaign also led to the discovery of systematic non-declaration of by-catch on board tuna fishing vessels, by a factor of as much as 3 or 4. Ships were observed discarding endangered species, such as Hammerhead and silky sharks. On board a Spanish vessel, Sea Shepherd and the Gabonese authorities discovered 69 tons of processed sharks and shark fins, despite the fact that the vessel was only licensed to fish for tuna and similar species. Sea Shepherd is currently working with the governments of the ship’s countries as well as the government of Gabon to invoke infringement proceedings against the vessels in question.  ©2024 Sea Shepherd Conservation Society

(Seychelles Defence Forces) (File photo): Seychelles Coast Guard vessel Zoroaster with a Sri Lankan fishing boat arrested in May 2022. (Seychelles Defence Forces) Photo license   (Seychelles News Agency) - The Seychelles Coast Guard intercepted three foreign vessels suspected of conducting illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the island nation's territorial waters between October to November, the Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) said on Friday.  The latest vessel to be caught is from Sri Lanka with seven crew, and was brought to port on November 22. The case is being investigated and the crew will be charged for illegally fishing in the Seychelles waters and using unauthorised fishing nets. Another vessel intercepted on November 16 was from the Comoros with four crew, and was intercepted in the Aldabra lagoon.  Since there was no catch onboard, the vessel was seized and the crew repatriated to their country. The first suspected illegal unreported and unregulated fishing vessel was also from Sri Lanka with six crew onboard and was apprehended and brought to port on October 20. The Seychelles Coast Guard is continuing to collaborate closely with the other concerned national agencies through an interagency framework to ensure proper liaison and coordination when such cases arise. This joint effort is proving to be effective in finding a solution to the persistent acts of illegal fishing in the Seychelles Exclusive Economic Zone of 1.4 million square kilometres.  ",2023-12-01
Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Google,Irish Fishing Industry Calls for Ban on Factory Ships in Ireland's EEZ,,2023-11-06
Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Google,How disappearing ships could hold the clue to stopping illegal fishing," Sign in On an early January afternoon, a South Korean fishing boat, the Oyang 77, departed from Montevideo, Uruguay, for the plentiful waters off the coast of Argentina. A month later, it would be apprehended by the coast guard for illegal fishing. As it intruded into Argentinaâs territorial waters, the boat left a telltale digital signature, one that could be used to catch outlaw fishermen across the planet.  The Oyang 77 headed out to sea before turning southwest to track the Argentinian coast. On Jan. 10, 2019, it turned off its location transponder and disappeared. Over the next 17 days, the vessel disabled its transponder eight more times. Its precise whereabouts during the gaps in its location data are unknown. Finally, on Feb. 7, the Oyang 77 reappeared and made a beeline for Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina. It was escorted by the coast guard, under arrest for illegally fishing in Argentinian waters. Commercial fishermen regularly disable their location transponders, sometimes for innocent reasons, but often to hide illegal activity. Researchers and government officials say the gaps in transponder data can be used to track illegal fishing â and to fight back.  Todayâs high seas are a bit like the Old West: a wilderness too vast to police, offering riches to those with a tolerance for danger and, sometimes, a dubious commitment to the law. A stark reality confronts anyone who seeks to rein in bad behavior on the ocean: it is very, very big. To pinpoint where in the haystack to search for needles, a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers called Global Fishing Watch collects data from fishing boatsâ Automatic Identification System (AIS) transponders, whose signals are picked up by satellites and land-based receivers. Recently, the team at Global Fishing Watch had a novel idea: instead of looking for where fishing boats broadcast their positions, what if they looked for where they hid them? âThe AIS data tells us a lot, but the absence of it does as well,â Tyler Clavelle, a data scientist at Global Fishing Watch, told me. Together with scientists from the University of California at Santa Cruz and NOAA Fisheries, Global Fishing Watch analyzed more than 28 billion AIS signals from 2017 to 2019. The researchers identified more than 55,000 gaps in the data and discovered that disabled transponders hide about 6 percent of the globeâs commercial fishing activity.

Thatâs just what the Oyang 77 did in early 2019 when it vanished and reappeared near the boundary of Argentinaâs EEZ. The South Korean-flagged trawler belonged to the fleet operated by the Sajo Oyang corporation, notorious for its record of high seas transgressions, as documented by The Guardian. In recent years, the Oyang 77 had gotten in trouble in New Zealand for illegally dumping dead fish overboard, underreporting catch and failing to pay workers, according to a report from Oceana, a nonprofit focused on ocean conservancy. In February 2019, the Argentine Coast Guard discovered the trawler with its nets extended inside the EEZ. They found more than 310,000 pounds of seafood on board. Leaving nothing to chance, they deployed a helicopter and an airplane to assist the Coast Guard in escorting the Oyang 77 to shore, releasing it after confiscating its fishing equipment and extracting a fine of 25 million Argentine pesos, or about $550,000. Sajo Oyang did not respond to multiple requests to comment. Global Fishing Watchâs data did not help catch the Oyang 77, but patrol boats from the U.S. Coast Guard and Canadaâs Department of Fisheries and Oceans already make use of it to decide which boats to pursue. Countries inspecting fishing boats in port can use Global Fishing Watchâs analytical tools to narrow their search. âYou can look up a vessel and see a history of its activity and quickly filter out vessels that appear to be operating above board, or identify vessels that have big gaps in their data or are operating in ways that are suspicious,â Clavelle said. Using shipsâ AIS data to enforce illegal fishing laws is not as easy as it sounds. AIS is not universally mandated aboard commercial fishing boats. Many fleets, including U.S. fishing boats, are tracked with a separate technology called the Vessel Monitoring System, which is visible to authorities but hidden from other vessels. AIS was created in the 1990s as a way to keep oil tankers from crashing. In the 2000s, private companies began launching satellites that could capture AIS signals from space, and a new industry emerged to supply government agencies with shipsâ location data. Yet even law-abiding fisherman sometimes wish to hide their location, either to conceal good fishing spots from competitors or to avoid capture in waters where pirates lurk. âWe thought we might have a pure illegal fishing story,â said Heather Welch, a NOAA affiliate and marine biologist at UC Santa Cruz, who led the research with Global Fishing Watch. âAnd it became very clear that thatâs not fair to the fishermen, that thatâs not the story weâre seeing here.â The researchers used a method of machine learning to separate the innocent AIS disabling from the nefarious. For instance, behavior that could have looked like statistical noise appeared to the researchersâ computer program as âloitering,â when boats with disabled transponders were motionless long enough to offload their catch to giant floating refrigerators called reefers. This is not always illegal, but it can be a way for boats with illegal catch to get rid of the evidence. âItâs a way to launder illegally caught seafood into the supply chain,â Welch told me. That makes it harder to know whether the fish at the grocery store was caught legally or not. The analysis could help coast guards pinpoint where and when illegal transshipment is likely to take place. Some in the fishing industry say that the rise of farmed seafood will reduce the opportunities for illegal fishing. The share of seafood from aquaculture grew from 6 percent in 1960 to 58 percent today, according to figures from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. That share is likely to keep rising, said Gavin Gibbons, vice president of communications at the National Fisheries Institute, an industry lobby. âThereâs only going to be more farmed going forward. Period. End of story,â Gibbons told me. âFarming will have to increase in order to feed a growing planet.â Yet aquaculture has only kept pace with the growth in seafood consumption and has not replaced wild caught seafood. Since the 1990s, wild seafood catch has stayed steady at about 100 million tons per year. In short, fish farming has not lowered the pressure on wild marine life. Even if aquaculture continues to grow, there will always be demand for wild caught fish, which many people prefer to the farmed variety. If aquaculture is not the solution to overfishing on the high seas, perhaps technology is. Global Fishing Watch and allies like Oceana, which co-founded the project in 2015, have pushed to require AIS on more commercial fishing boats. Global Fishing Watchâs next goal is to learn to detect fishing boats directly from satellite imagery, which would reveal far more activity than AIS signals alone. âWhat gets monitored gets managed,â Clavelle told me. âSo if you canât see whatâs happening on the ocean, how do you expect to manage it properly?â Programming note: I am grateful to my teammates, especially Niko Kommenda, for polishing up this column while I was off becoming a dad this week.

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Google,"6 Facts You May Not Know About Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing"," Navigate to: Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing significantly harms not only fish populations and ocean health but also people—so much so that in 2017, the United Nations declared June 5 the International Day for the Fight Against IUU Fishing.  To mark this year’s IUU Day, we’re sharing are six problems that illicit fishing causes—a list that highlights the need for stronger national and international laws to prevent, deter and prosecute fisheries crime.   Estimates from a benchmark study published in the journal Marine Policy suggest that 1 in 5 wild-caught marine fish are landed from IUU fishing. Global Financial Integrity, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank that focuses on illicit trade and corruption, says that IUU fishing generates up to $36.4 billion per year in illegal profits, with untold billions of dollars lost to the global economy in unpaid taxes, customs, license fees and numerous other pieces of the legal seafood supply chain. Further, IUU fishing, which contributes to overfishing globally, also disproportionately impacts small island and developing States.  In April 2023, an Associated Press series highlighted how IUU fishing and overfishing of certain species threatened cultural practices. For example, the Senegalese national dish is thieboudienne, a fish and rice pot meal made primarily from local white grouper. But overfishing and increased illegal fishing have damaged coastal fisheries, and the population of this fish that people have eaten for generations has collapsed. Similarly, in the Bahamas, the population of conch, which has substantial cultural and economic value in the region, has been depleted so severely that, according to the Associated Press, within a decade it may “cease to be commercially viable.” Around the world, and especially where governments lack fisheries enforcement resources, coastal communities are suffering from the impacts of IUU fishing.  According to a 2022 FISH Safety Foundation study, commissioned by Pew, more than 100,000 people die annually while engaged in legal commercial or IUU fishing. While fishing is inherently risky, the study highlights how IUU fishing and overfishing exacerbate and contribute to these deaths. For example, in the Indian Ocean off Madagascar, illegal fishing may represent as much as half of the total catch due to IUU activity from the industrial and artisanal sectors. Local fishers have lost revenue due to the drop in accessible catch and have been forced to go farther out to sea, significantly increasing their safety risk and leading to higher levels of mortality.  While the on-the-water consequences of illegal fishing are clear, it’s not just those going out to sea that have livelihoods in peril. Those who work in related artisanal industries—including boat construction, net repair, ice hauling and fish processing—are all seeing reduced work and revenues. In West Africa, for example, women are the main processers and traders of fish at market, and the reduction of local fish catch due to illegal activities and overfishing is having a negative economic impact on them.  Illegal fishers often disregard multiple rules at once, including those that prohibit destructive methods. For example, some IUU fishers practice blast fishing—detonating explosives to stun fish and damage their swim bladders—which often kills all marine life in the blast’s radius, causing immense damage to the marine ecosystem. In some places, fishers use cyanide powder to stun—but not kill—colorful tropical fish, which are then sold on the exotic pet market. Cyanide can also bleach or kill coral reefs.   While grocery stores may list where fish are caught, the involvement of multiple countries in fishing activities can often obscure the true source. Some ecolabels can aid in making smart choices, but they rarely tell the full story. Until there is a traceable chain of custody from the time a fish leaves the water to the time it hits the shelf, customers cannot have 100% confidence in the origin country of their fish. Fishing is a challenging global problem, but there are ways to address it, beginning with an effective, comprehensive governance or management regime. Enforcing existing laws—including by prosecuting crime and fining those caught breaking laws—would help shift the dynamics at sea. As with any crime, stronger monitoring and enforcement should lead to a decrease in illegal and destructive activity. Regional partnerships with stronger monitoring and enforcement through increasingly sophisticated technologies, such as satellite monitoring, are making a dent. Additionally, when countries fulfil their international commitments on fisheries governance and work together by sharing information with each other and within own national agencies, it has a positive effect. For instance, in 2016 the United Nations Port State Measures Agreement, which was designed to strengthen and harmonize fisheries enforcement at ports around the world, was ratified and entered into force. Today, more than 100 States are party to the treaty and, as implementation continues, are helping spotlight the provenance of fish being landed.   Those working on fishing vessels need protections, too. The International Labour Organization’s Convention 188 sets requirements for better labor conditions on fishing vessels, and the International Maritime Organization’s Cape Town Agreement, which has not yet entered force, will raise safety standards onboard fishing vessels. Applied together, these three treaties can help turn the tide on IUU.

 In the small hours of an August morning in 2022, enforcement officers in Shanghai intercepted a speedboat at the Yangtze River estuary. On board, they found eight people engaged in illegal fishing, 91kg of blue crabs, and prohibited netting. It was later established that the speedboat was unregistered, with no official name, number, certification or homeport registration. Such raids of unregistered vessels frequently make the news in China. Some are used for sleeping, catering or sand dredging. Of those vessels used for fishing, most act illegally. This is seriously disrupting fisheries management and driving the precipitous decline of inshore fish stocks. Wei Zhou, who heads the oceans programme at Greenpeace East Asia, tells Dialogue Earth: “Reliable data is the basis for fisheries management, with fisheries agencies knowing the number of fishing vessels out there and the size of their catch … the presence of unregistered vessels clearly complicates the compilation of data on actual capacity and catch size. This undermines the work of fisheries management.” At a 2021 press conference, China’s Fisheries Administration director Liu Xinzhong said unregistered boats had long been the scourge of fisheries enforcement. As early as 1987, China began restricting the numbers and engine sizes of fishing vessels. The fisheries law, which came into force at that time, required boats to have valid registration and inspection certificates, and a fishing licence. However, by 2003 the system had not been fully implemented in many coastal areas, because the grant support fishers needed to join an alternative industry had not been made available. In the 1990s, the central government became alert to the overexploitation of fish stocks. The State Council decreed a crackdown on unregistered boats in 1994, seizing vessels and fining owners. That remains the core of fishery law enforcement efforts today. Since 2017, more than 200,000 fishing vessels have been declared illegal and scrapped by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. However, fishers continue taking the risk in pursuit of commercial gain. In July 2019, a reporter from Zhejiang Online joined enforcement officials in the eastern city of Wenzhou. They were investigating illegal activity during that year’s “closed season”. In the East China Sea, this fishing moratorium runs between May and September, to preserve and restore fish stocks. When asked why they broke the law, fishers pointed to higher prices during the closed season. A full supply chain was in place and dealers stood by for off-the-books orders – there was “no worry about not being able to sell”. Enforcement officials told Zhejiang Online that most fishing craft active during the closed season – usually wooden boats or foam rafts – were unregistered. It only took poachers a day or two, with luck, to recoup the typical vessel construction cost of CNY 10,000-20,000 (USD 1,400-2,800). Not only do most unregistered fishing vessels break the closed season’s moratorium, but they also fish with illegal, fine-mesh nets and practice electric pulse fishing. These actions have the potential to decimate stocks to the extent that properly registered vessels have “nothing left to catch” in coastal waters. According to a 2021 Greenpeace report, large numbers of unregistered boats were operating covertly across China’s inland waterways and seas, often by night or in overlapping jurisdictions, where enforcement is intermittent. Some operators are even willing to chance their luck on the high seas, the report states. This all adds to the difficulty of on-the-spot enforcement. Promoting the standardised application of onboard technologies such as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) can enhance fisheries management, the Greenpeace report suggests. AIS transmits any seaborne vessel’s ID, position, speed and course around the clock to onshore base stations, satellites, and all other in-range, AIS-equipped vessels. Dialogue Earth consulted Nate Miller, head of applied research at the data-sharing NGO Global Fishing Watch. He says AIS was originally designed to aid navigation and prevent collisions, but it is increasingly used by authorities and NGOs to identify vessels that are fishing and monitor their activity. What are purse seiners? Purse seiners are fishing boats that use vertical, potentially kilometres-long nets (the “seine”) to surround fish. These nets are then pulled together (“pursed”) at the bottom to complete the catch. Machine learning is now being used to process large amounts of AIS data, which feeds models that can differentiate between types of fishing vessels. A trawler, for example, will usually pass repeatedly over a relatively shallow area at intermediate speeds; a purse seiner may move in straight lines, then in tight circles as it deploys its net. In the past few years, AIS data has played a part in multiple seaborne enforcement actions in China. Last year, enforcement officers in Guangdong used it to identify fishing boats via those tell-tale movements, which enabled patrols to conduct on-the-spot verification. While AIS data is relatively accurate in most cases, information such as vessel names and route plans must be entered manually and can be altered. In 2021, the Work Safety Committee of the State Council discovered two instances of falsified AIS information during unannounced inspections. The crews said they had chosen to falsify information rather than switch off their AIS because they wanted it on for safety only, not for oversight. In 2021, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs demanded the rollout of AIS that incorporates ID cards in coastal provinces, following a successful pilot in Fujian province. Developed by the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, the cards aim to prevent data tampering, destruction or deliberate disconnection. The academy claims these difficult-to-remove cards ensure their systems are online 99.7% of the time, compared with 30-40% for conventional equipment. Miller points out that AIS still depends on ships transmitting information about their own position, however. If an unregistered vessel is not fitted with AIS or switches it off, other tools such as satellite imagery and radar come into play, supported by information from port authorities. The fishery bureau in Xiangshan county has been using radar and CCTV to monitor its patch of the East China Sea since May 2019. The system scans the port’s waters every 2.5 seconds, checking the legality of inbound and outbound fishing vessels. It does this by comparing hull identification numbers, and BeiDou Navigation Satellite (BDS) and AIS data. It automatically alerts the police when an unregistered vessel is identified, boosting enforcement efficiency. As of 2021, the county had seized 285 unregistered vessels. In Wei Zhou’s view, technology can indeed make enforcement more effective, but surveillance-led enforcement cannot fully resolve the problem of unregistered fishing vessels. She says systematic solutions are needed. The past decade has proven that ensuring fishers can access alternative sources of income is part of the solution to these problems. In 2015, People’s Daily (the official state newspaper) interviewed Mr Zhang, a struggling ex-fisher in his 50s living in the coastal city of Ningbo, south of Shanghai. The lifelong fisher described how he had invested in building his own boat when the market was buoyant, before being forced to sell it during a market downturn. With no other assets or vocational skills, however, he had little choice but to continue fishing with an unregistered boat. That vessel was confiscated in 2014. A year later, Zhang was working part-time for CNY 2,000-3,000 (USD 270-415) a month – far less than a full-time member of China’s subsidised coastal fisheries workforce would hope to earn in 2015. At the time, the then-deputy director of Xiangshan’s Marine and Fisheries Bureau warned there were few options besides the sea for those in under-resourced coastal areas. Owners of fishing boats in such areas tend to be older and have less transferrable labour skills, making it hard for them to switch industries. Fishery officials and experts said bespoke, targeted policies would be necessary if fishers were to be resettled in a fair and just manner. Provinces and municipalities have been holding mass scrappage events for years, crushing unregistered vessels to send out a warning. But a 2018 study by Zhejiang Ocean University revealed a resurgence in active, unregistered craft in the province’s coastal areas. Such stubborn trends were chiefly attributed to fishers’ financial pressures. Additionally, bans on fishing along the Yangtze River, imposed during the 2020s, have decommissioned more than 100,000 legally registered boats. This has had implications for the redeployment and relocation of more than 200,000 people; this issue has large, far-reaching impacts. In early April, China’s Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security issued an update regarding the Yangtze River ban. It said by 2023, 154,000 of the impacted fishers who still had the ability and willingness to work had transferred to other jobs. However, local law enforcement continues to reveal unregistered vessels across the country, including along the Zhejiang and Guangdong coasts and the Yangtze this year. The situation suggests that, while technology is helping to tackle unregistered fishing vessels, the pressures leading many to fish illegally in the first place need consideration.

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Google,"To fight illegal fishing in the Galapagos, Ecuador turns to Canadian satellite and sensing technology"," From a naval command centre perched on the coast of Ecuador's Galapagos Islands, Capt. Isiais Bodero Mala surveyed incoming satellite feeds tracking fishing vessels circling one of the world's most biodiverse places. Mala was previously a submarine commander, so conservation monitoring wasn't initially a first-choice assignment for the long-serving mariner. But with hundreds of fishing boats routinely stalking around the world-famous marine protected area for endangered hammerhead sharks, giant squids and other species, his work here is increasingly vital. Ecuador and other Latin American countries have tasked their security forces with cracking down on the fleets poaching from their waters. Standing in front of large computer screens with other sailors in crisp white uniforms, Mala recounted a story from a fellow submarine commander who was using sonar to listen to a ""massive school of fish"" from his battle station while tracking a flotilla of Chinese ships. ""After the fishing fleet had passed, there was complete silence — the fish had disappeared,"" Mala said in an interview.  About one in five fish consumed globally is either caught illegally without proper reporting or regulations to protect the sustainability of fish populations, according to a British study. It's an enterprise worth up to $50 billion US annually, depriving some of the world's poorest coastal communities of crucial nutrition and income, exacerbating declining stocks and threatening endangered species. June 5 is the United Nations' International Day for the Fight against Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU), and officials say the problem is only getting worse globally.  As co-ordinated fishing fleets increasingly prowl the world's oceans — often entering the waters of small developing nations — governments and conservationists are increasingly turning to space-based technology to push back against the industrial-scale theft of marine resources.  In Ecuador, the government has enlisted help from Canadian tech companies and Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to tackle the problem. ""There has been a big change on the technology front in recent years,"" said Sean Wheeler, DFO's chief of international programs. ""Before, we were missing the ability to see the whole state of play."" With tens of thousands of industrial fishing boats operating across the world's oceans, pinpointing illicit operators is like searching for a ""needle in a haystack,"" said Mark Carmichael, a senior executive with the Brampton, Ont.-based space technology firm MDA. Under a $7-million project financed by Ottawa, the company, which is behind the Canadarm on the International Space Station, is providing satellite tracking, remote sensing and the ability to synthesize large amounts of data to Ecuador's navy. Linking feeds from powerful satellites, including MDA's Radarsat-2, with vessel ownership data and records of past offences can help security forces zero in on ships carrying out illicit activities, DFO's Wheeler said.  Other organizations, including the Google-backed tracking group Global Fishing Watch, provide Ecuador with artificial intelligence interpreting boat movements, including fishing operations in prohibited areas. These different pieces of information are uploaded onto a map in one of Ecuador's naval operation centres, allowing security forces to better pick their battles for intercepting suspicious ships. It's logistically impossible to inspect every ship on the high seas, Wheeler said, so ""space-based [satellites] allow countries to better organize the limited resources we all have."" Environmental crimes, including illegal fishing, are the world's third-most lucrative illicit enterprise, according to the global police organization Interpol, just behind drugs and counterfeit goods — and ahead of human trafficking. The prevalence of these crimes has been increasing ""drastically"" at five per cent annually, Interpol reported, with ""huge profits to be made and risk factors relatively low in terms of penalty."" An estimated 11 to 26 million tonnes of fish are illegally captured and unreported annually, according to estimates from an Imperial College London study cited by the United Nations. The tide, however, could be starting to turn. ""There is increasing global momentum to address crimes in the fisheries sector,"" said Lejda Toci, an officer with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). ""There are some very good initiatives countries have amongst themselves from satellite imagery, mapping the vessels, tracking the vessels and databases of suspicious vessels."" All large commercial ships are supposed to use a tracking tool called an Automatic Identification System (AIS), which reveals locations and voyage information to avoid collisions. Ships engaged in illegal fishing, however, often shut off their AIS, particularly when they enter a sensitive area like the Galapagos Marine Reserve, said Capt. Mala. A Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) also broadcasts a ship's identity, location and speed, but it only sends out a signal every couple of hours — and it, too, can be turned off. Monitoring AIS or VMS movements is often the first tool used by navies to combat illegal fishing. But when vessels turn off their locators and ""go dark,"" more advanced tech tools need to be unsheathed. ""The only way to find the dark vessels is to do surveillance from space,"" Carmichael said. To make that happen, MDA is working with Ecuador to pursue other signals. When boats shut off their trackers before sailing into protected areas, some mariners still need to stay in touch with the outside world via satellite phones. Additionally, ships usually keep their onboard radar functioning to avoid collisions. Boat engines also unintentionally emit electromagnetic waves constituting a specific signature. Some of these signals can be followed by MDA with radio frequency sensing, a military technology now available for civilian use, Carmichael said. MDA satellites can pinpoint radio waves emitted by satellite phones or onboard navigation systems, even if a ship's other location information has been hidden or corrupted. Another tool, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), picks up radar wave reflections from boats at sea even if their other tracking tools are off, creating an image that is then relayed to authorities. SAR is especially useful for visualizing boats in remote locations or during periods of bad weather when other technologies, such as Very High Resolution satellite imagery, are less effective.  Sustainable fishing is needed to <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaveOurOcean?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#SaveOurOcean</a> &amp; protect the livelihoods of millions of people.<br><br>On Saturday's Day of Illegal, Unreported &amp; Unregulated Fishing, see how <a href=""https://twitter.com/FAO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@FAO</a> is helping to end this harmful practice. <a href=""https://t.co/BgyRUCE0En"">https://t.co/BgyRUCE0En</a> <a href=""https://t.co/9gvHpFYbCL"">pic.twitter.com/9gvHpFYbCL</a> First developed for submarine warfare, Passive Acoustic Systems monitor underwater listening devices to identify a ship's location and the type of fishing gear it's using based on the sound it makes while sailing. Data from all of these complex systems is combined with the help of advanced algorithms, Carmichael said, and provided to Ecuador's naval operations centres. With location information projected on computer screens, intelligence operatives can then dispatch their forces more efficiently. ""We get information from the operations centre. Then we are sent out,"" said Jorge Lopez, commander of Ecuador's machine-gun-equipped offshore patrol vessel Isla Isabela. The patrol ship has special image recognition software that can identify endangered sharks his team might find onboard a fishing boat just by their fins.  As a result of this kind of data, Lopez said his forces were able to intervene against nine semi-industrial boats harvesting from waters reserved for small fishermen last year. Caught illegally harvesting, some of those fishermen are still in jail, he added. According to a recently passed law, fishing vessels operating in Ecuador's waters are supposed to be outfitted with AIS. But the law has yet to be fully implemented. For now, only industrial fishing ships, and artisanal fishing boats allowed to operate within the Galapagos marine reserve, are equipped and monitored, fishermen and officials said. The rise of AIS and other satellite tracking tech hasn't been met with universal support. Some small-scale fishermen welcome the new technology as a tool to protect law-abiding harvesters around the Galapagos. It also allows relatives to know their kin are safe at sea. ""The AIS is an excellent idea,"" said 70-year-old Alberto Granja, a longtime Galapagos resident and retired fisheries worker. The problem, he said, is that buying the gear costs $1,200 US and many of the trackers donated to local fishermen by conservation groups now need to be replaced. To other fishermen, the technology is little more than red tape — one more piece of kit poor workers have to maintain on their boats — and a symptom of government overreach. ""There are huge Chinese fleets out there,"" he said. ""There is no control of big boats outside the reserve… The Chinese have the technology to detect where the fish are, but we don't."" Chinese fishing incursions into the Galapagos's exclusive economic zone have not been a regular occurrence since a flotilla of more than 300 boats besieged the area in 2020, drawing a public rebuke from Ecuador's government, as well as naval action and international headlines. Since then, the fleet seems to have kept away from the Galapagos, focusing instead on other parts of South America. Ecuadorian officials have met with Beijing's representatives on the issue, Capt. Mala said. China's embassy in Ecuador did not respond to requests for comment.  With few enforceable rules on what boats can take from the high seas, there is not much that can be done about the fleet's activities today, conservationists said. China is still not part of the Port State Measures Agreement, a key UN treaty enabling port inspections crucial to reducing the laundering of illegally caught fish. While Chinese vessels are thought to be the worst offenders when it comes to large-scale illegal practices — including the 2017 actions of the vessel Fu Yuan Yu Leung, caught with some 7,000 sharks aboard, many of them endangered species — ships from Ecuador and nearby nations certainly aren't innocent. Between 2018 and 2020, more than 135 unauthorized Ecuadorian industrial fishing boats were caught operating inside the marine protected area, according to data from the Galapagos National Park.  To try and build a united front for conservation, Ecuador has partnered with neighbours Colombia, Costa Rica and Panama to link several marine protected areas, including the Galapagos, creating an uninterrupted corridor for sharks, turtles, whales and other sea life spanning 500,000 square kilometres. Presidents of the four nations announced plans for the Eastern Tropical Pacific Marine Corridor (CMAR) during the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, last November. In January 2022, Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso signed a declaration expanding the Galapagos Marine Reserve by 60,000 square kilometres, an area larger than Nova Scotia, bringing the Galapagos marine protected area to 198,000 square kilometres. Tracking boats at sea is just one part of the equation, said analysts. Navies, especially in cash-strapped countries across the Global South, have limited resources to chase down and board vessels inside their own exclusive economic zones. Rather than following boats, some tech experts are turning their attention to tracking the fish itself. At some point, illegally caught fish will be sold to consumers, and naming and shaming repeat offenders at the retail level can be a powerful tool. This, however, is harder than tracking ships. The mixing up of fish from different boats and even fishing areas through the transfer of catch at sea, a process known as transshipment, means tracing the origins of the marine life sold in different products is challenging. Many seafood traders also mislabel fish shipments, to avoid taxes, regulations or simply increase profits, conservationists said. Moreover, it is not known how much of the illegally caught fish ends up in mixed products, such as fish meal and pet food, for which the origins are often even more difficult to ascertain. ""It's really hard to have traceability for fish and seafood with transshipment,"" said Nancy De Lemos from the monitoring group Global Fishing Watch. ""It's hard to identify which fish comes from a legitimate activity and which does not.""  Her organization is trying to address that by tracking transshipments to identify which vessel was shifting the catch and where the mothership eventually docks. But even if a large ship thought to be engaged in illicit transshipments on the high seas is tracked to port, that information alone often isn't enough to bring criminals to justice. So much of our <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/ocean?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#ocean</a> is hidden from view. Just a decade ago, building an accurate picture of human activity at sea was impossible.

Bad actors can use loopholes in national legislation or register in a secretive jurisdiction regardless of where they fish, she added. ""These are all aspects that make it particularly susceptible to transnational organized crime and corruption."" More than one third of global fish stocks are being overexploited, according to UN data, and the impacts of illegal fishing are getting worse. Working at a stall in an open-air Galapagos market, 52-year-old fishmonger Marisa Felipe Suarez is one of the millions of people hurt by the mechanized pilfering of the world's oceans.  Wearing a blue cap and a big smile, she's married to a fisherman and regularly sails the Galapagos's waters herself with a licence for a small catch. ""This is a maritime reserve of international value,"" she said of the islands, which have enough diversity of life to have inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. ""There should be help to stop [illegal fishing] from navies all over the world. These big fishing boats come from afar, take everything and then bring the fish back to their countries.""

A Bull Trout Species Management and Recovery Plan was prepared in 1995; subsequently, the status of various populations was reviewed in greater detail and an updated conservation management plan was published in March 2012. A zero limit has been placed on bull trout in Alberta until such time as there is a harvestable surplus. A major information and education initiative has been ongoing since the 1995 management plan was completed. The slogan ""No black, put it back!"" has been developed to reinforce the zero catch limit, as bull trout do not have any black spots or marks on their dorsal fins. Trout Unlimited Canada has embarked on an extensive sign campaign along streams throughout the entire eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta to caution anglers not to keep any bull trout.

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Bing,Freshwater Fish Species," Freshwater Fish Species Knowing all about freshwater fish species, their characteristics, habitat, and tips for catching them can refine your fishing skills when out on the water. The more knowledge you have about the different types of freshwater fish habitats and feeding habits, the better an angler you can become, and you will be better equipped to follow the state fishing laws and regulations for each species. Freshwater fish species are generally separated into one of three different categories (warmwater, coldwater or coolwater) based on water temperature and the associated amount of oxygen in the water at each temperature range. For example, cold water holds more oxygen than warm water, which means coldwater fish will require higher oxygen levels in order to survive. Warmwater fish species: These fish can live in a wide range of conditions. Largemouth bass, bluegill, catfish, crappies and sunfish are all considered warmwater species. Although they can survive cold winters in the northern states and can be found throughout most of the U.S., warmwater species will thrive best when water temperatures are around 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Coldwater fish species: The second category of freshwater fish is the coldwater species category. As you might imagine, coldwater fish species require cold water temperatures in order to survive. Trout, Salmon, and Smelt are some of the most common coldwater game fish species. These types of freshwater fish prefer water temperatures between 50 and 60 degrees. Because these species grow best in colder tempatures they are most often found in the northern states or states with higher elevation and cold wind temperatures. Coolwater fish species: The third category of freshwater fish is the coolwater species category. Muskellunge, northern pike, walleye, and yellow perch are among the most common coolwater game fish species. These types of freshwater fish prefer water temperatures in-between the other two categories. Because these species grow best in water temperatures that range in the 60's and 70's, they are most often found in the northern and midwestern states. Finding a place to go freshwater fishing is easy due to the fact there are plenty of helpful resources to point you in the right direction. There are lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams and ponds across the U.S. that can provide the ideal opportunities for you and your family to catch a number of different types of freshwater fish. Look for top freshwater spots to fish and boat  in your area or ask for some suggestions when visiting your local tackle shop. Inhabiting waters in almost every state, largemouth bass are the most popular freshwater game fish.

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Bing,Explore this abandoned ship captain's house with a tragic past,,2024-06-05
Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Bing,2 cargo ships caught fire after being hit by projectiles in suspected Houthi attacks off the coast of Yemen," Two cargo ships traveling off Yemen's southern port city of Aden caught fire after being hit by projectiles suspected to have been fired by Houthi rebels, UK maritime agencies reported. United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said on Sundayit had been informed of an incident 80 nautical miles southeast of Aden. UKMTO is linked to the UK's Royal Navy.  Suspicion for the attack fell on Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have not claimed responsibility for the latest attack but have been targeting shipping in the area for several months with missiles and drones. The British security firm Ambrey later said a cargo vessel from Antigua and Barbuda had been hit by a missile 83 nautical miles southeast of Aden. The ship caught fire but it was contained. ""The ship was heading southwest along the Gulf of Aden at a speed of 8.2 knots when a missile struck the forward station. A fire started but was neutralized,"" Ambrey said in an advisory note seen by Reuters. ""A second missile was sighted but did not hit the ship. Persons on board small boats in the vicinity opened fire on the ship during the incident,"" Ambrey said. No injuries were reported after the ship diverted and sped up. The UKMTO said they had received a second report about another incident 70 nautical miles southwest of Aden. ""The master reports that the vessel was hit by an unknown projectile on the aft section, which resulted in a fire. Damage control is underway,"" UKMTO said. No casualties were reported and the UKMTO said the vessel was ""proceeding to its next port of call. Authorities continue to monitor the situation."" Reuters reported on Friday that the Houthi rebels had claimed responsibility for attacks on two merchant ships in the Red Sea with ""a number of drones and ballistic and naval missiles,"" but there was no independent confirmation of the incidents. Houthis have been targeting ships in the Red Sea corridor and the Gulf of Aden with missiles and drones as part of a campaign that aims to put pressure on Israel and the West over the war in Gaza. Shipping vessels have been forced to take longer and more costly routes around the south of Africa. A US Navy carrier strike group and warships from European nations have defended the key shipping lanes. On Monday, the Houthi rebels said they had fired a new solid-fuel missile called the ""Palestine"" at the southern Israeli city of Eilat on Monday. The rebels have also detained 11 Yemeni employees of UN agencies under uncertain circumstances, it was reported on Friday. ""We are very concerned about these developments, and we're actively seeking clarification from the Houthi de facto authorities regarding the circumstances of these detentions,"" UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in New York. Of the 11, the UN said six had been working for the UN's human rights agency, and the rest all worked separately for its special envoy's office, its development arm, Unicef, the World Food Program, and Unesco. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that the US was planned to further increase economic pressure on the Houthis by blocking their revenue sources. This includes preventing a $1.5 billion Saudi payment to cover salaries for government employees in militia-held territory. Advertisement POPULAR CATEGORIES Copyright © 2023. Times Internet Limited.

The dramatic operation, led by the US Coast Guard and the Royal Netherlands Navy, led to 4,800 pounds of cocaine being recovered from a vessel at a Florida port.  The Coast Guard released a social media post, showing officers from both agencies offloading large sealed containers from the ship onto pallets at Port Everglades in Florida. The Coast Guard has seized $63m worth of cocaine on the high seas after a deadly shootout The dramatic operation, led by the US Coast Guard and the Royal Netherlands Navy, led to 4,800 pounds of cocaine being recovered from a vessel at a Florida port According to a press release, the crew opened fire on the suspected smugglers when the 'non-compliant vessel' abruptly changed course, hurtling toward them at high speed.  The seizure Thursday was the result of a joint operation between the two agencies, including two actions off the coast of Puerta Cabello, Venezuela, the Coast Guard said in a social media post.  The team engaged a high-speed vessel in the Caribbean Sea thought to be smuggling narcotics, a Coast Guard spokesperson said in n a release Tuesday.  The vessel refused orders to stop and instead increased speed and changed direction toward the Dutch pursuit boat.  The boat of Dutch and US Coast Guard members opened fire on the boat in self-defense, US Coast Guard officials said. The vessel caught fire and sank. Three suspected smugglers went overboard.  According to a press release, the crew opened fire on the suspected smugglers when the 'non-compliant vessel' abruptly changed course, hurtling toward them at high speed It was the second time the joint operation engaged a vessel believed to be carrying drugs this week A search for the smugglers was suspended Tuesday, authorities said. The press release emphasized that the actions of both US and Dutch sailors were taken in self-defense and to protect others in the face of imminent danger.

Vessel caught with unrecorded fish species,Bing,"Suspected attack by Yemen’s Houthi rebels sees missiles strike ship in Gulf of Aden, sparking blaze"," A suspected attack Thursday by Yemen’s Houthi rebels saw missiles strike a ship in the Gulf of Aden, authorities said, setting the vessel ablaze in what would be the latest such assault in their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war. The attack happened in the Gulf of Aden off Yemen, the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre said. It said the vessel caught fire in the attack. The private security firm Ambrey said a merchant vessel made a radio distress call saying it had been struck by a missile. The ship “was en route from Malaysia to Venice, Italy,” Ambrey said. It added that the ship was “aligned with the Houthi target profile,” without elaborating. Later on Thursday, the UKMTO reported a second suspected attack off Yemen’s port city of Hodeida, but said the blast happened away from the vessel and did not damage it. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge Thursday’s attacks, but it typically takes the rebels hours or even days to claim them. The attack follows the Houthis launching a boat-borne bomb attack against a commercial ship in the Red Sea on Wednesday. The Houthis, who seized Yemen’s capital nearly a decade ago and have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition since shortly after, have been targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor. They say the attacks are aimed at stopping the war and supporting the Palestinians, though the attacks often target vessels that have nothing to do with the conflict. The war in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there, according to Gaza health officials, while hundreds of others have been killed in Israeli operations in the West Bank. It began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. A U.S.-led air strike campaign has targeted the Houthis since January, with a series of strikes May 30 killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, the rebels say. Also Thursday, the Washington-based National Democratic Institute said three of its staff were detained by the Houthis earlier this month. Their detention comes as staff of United Nations agencies and those working for aid groups also have been detained in a widening crackdown by the rebels. “This arbitrary and inhumane treatment of Yemeni citizens involved in humanitarian assistance, diplomacy, democracy and human rights, peacemaking and civil society development is entirely without foundation and must be ended immediately,” the institute said. It called for the “swift release by the Houthi regime of our staff, and of all individuals who have been unjustly detained.” The institute is a democracy promotion organization that has worked in Yemen since 1993. It receives funding from the U.S. government and others.

          MIAMI (AP) — A joint operation of the US Coast Guard and the Royal Netherlands Navy recovered 4,800 pounds (2,177 kilograms) of cocaine worth more than $63 million this week from a vessel at a Florida port, according to the Coast Guard. The seizure Thursday was the result of a joint operation between the two agencies, including two actions off the coast of Puerta Cabello, Venezuela, the Coast Guard said in a social media post. The post showed officers from both agencies offloading large sealed containers from the ship onto pallets at Port Everglades in Florida.  It was the second time the joint operation engaged a vessel believed to be carrying drugs this week.

The boat of Dutch and US Coast Guard members opened fire on the boat in self-defense, US Coast Guard officials said.  The vessel caught fire and sank. Three suspected smugglers went overboard. A search for the smugglers was suspended Tuesday, authorities said. ",11 days ago
Vessel caught bypassing quota system,Google,‘Phenomenal loophole’ in quotas could lead to massive overfishing," Exclusive: Drastically weakened rules on how vessels document their catches of endangered species could endanger the marine ecosystem, confidential EU papers reveal A push by EU fishing nations including France and Spain to weaken how fish catches are reported could see massive overfishing of endangered species and even “call into question” the whole point of setting quotas, according to confidential EU documents seen by the Guardian. Europe’s most commonly fished species – which include mackerel, tuna, Atlantic herring and sprat – could be threatened under the latest proposal, which would apply to all vessels in EU waters. At issue is how fish catches are logged to ensure that vessels are not overfishing. Bloc rules currently allow a 10% margin of tolerance between the declared catch for each fish species in a vessel’s logbook and the quantity they report after landing. But fishing nations want to expand a loophole applied to the Baltic in 2016 that widens the scope of the 10% margin to vessels’ total catches. Such a “phenomenal loophole” removes any penalty for vessels that submit completely inaccurate estimates for vulnerable fish species, according to one of the European Commission papers. The loophole has “incentivised hidden overfishing and even calls into question the usefulness of fishing conservation measures, such as quota setting, in a scenario where such quotas can be easily circumvented without any consequence”, the paper said. The papers, circulated to diplomats and parliamentary negotiators in February, added: “This derogation has led to huge misreporting, in particular underreporting and overfishing of quota species. Misreporting of catches is the precursor to unsustainable fishing, which over time risks resulting in depletion of fish stocks and ultimately to disruption of the marine ecosystem.” Preliminary EU audits found that misreporting in the Baltic last year was “incentivised” by the derogation and was accompanied by overfishing, another document says. Sprat, for example, is a species protected by a quota, but in samples from one EU state, sprat was underreported by 78%, while hauls of non-quota species were overreported by 819%, according to the audit, which is mentioned in the EU papers. The average underreporting of herring and sprat in another state were 36% and 63% respectively. Conservationists fear that such underreporting could have permanent repercussions on the vulnerable fish. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) committee, which gives the EU scientific advice on catch limits, has called for precautionary quotas to protect sprat populations in the Baltic. Massimiliano Cardinale, an adviser to ICES, said that applying the margin of tolerance to total catches put populations of smaller fish in jeopardy. “If you fish two stocks that have a very different biomass with a 10% total catch tolerance, you will have a much larger risk of overfishing the smaller population,” he said. “That’s just an obvious consequence.” Fish stocks most threatened by weakened reporting protocols include yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean, which thinktanks and marine scientists have warned could collapse by 2026 if overfishing continues. EU fishing boats scoop up around a third of the ocean’s tuna catch. They use a method called purse seine that uses nets about 2km long and 200m deep, which also trapnon-target species such as sea turtles, sharks and rays, according to the Global Tuna Alliance, an independent tuna industry association. They also trap mainly juvenile tuna, which make up 63-71% of the EU fleet’s yellowfin tuna catch using this purse seining method, depending on the time of year, according to October 2022 data from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. Sign up to Down to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Against this backdrop, entrenching the 10% reporting loophole would “legalise misreporting, in particular underreporting of several if not all quota species, erasing almost 40 years of improved accuracy of catch reporting in the EU, by bringing EU fishing standards back to 1983,” the first commission document says. It would also “go against” targets in the Cop15 agreement on nature protection. The quarrel is part of an internal EU haggle over modernising fisheries controls, which were proposed by Brussels in 2018 but challenged ever since by fishing nations such as France, Denmark and Spain. The EU’s environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevičius, has compromised on plans to fit CCTV onboard all vessels, but made the loophole a red line. He has reportedly threatened to withdraw the entire legislative package in negotiations on Wednesday, according to two officials. Sinkevičius declined to comment. Europêche, the fishing industry trade group, argued that it is too difficult to apply the new rules to fleets fishing for species such as tropical tuna, and that the suspension of fishing licences and “immobilisation” of vessels after they have amassed too many penalty points is unfair. Defending the proposals, Daniel Voces, the managing director of Europêche, said: “The current provisions relating to the margin of tolerance are penalising our shipowners and skippers, particularly the tuna industry, who are facing extreme sanctions, the allocation of points and even risking losing their jobs due to the impossibility to comply with a rule that is unworkable for the industry in its current form. “If the problem is not fixed soon, I’m afraid the EU tuna purse seine fleet will disappear in a matter of years.” The marine conservation group Oceana disputed the scale of the cost posed to industry by the new rules. “Only a handful of serial offenders risk becoming unprofitable,” said Vanya Vulperhorst, Oceana’s campaign director. Giving in to them would be “a complete contradiction of the EU’s zero-tolerance policy to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, [and] put further at risk already overfished stocks such as yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean”.",2023-03-16
Vessel caught bypassing quota system,Google,"Grounded: Rather than test new limits, fisherman ties up his boat"," NEW BEDFORD — ""It was the lesser of two evils,"" said Tony Pereira of his decision to enter a sector, as the new fishery management system is known. His other alternative, fishing under regulations that would have limited his days at sea to 35, was unattractive. ""It started out at a hundred and twenty days but every year it was getting reduced by a certain percentage,"" he said. Sectors, in which boats are grouped by category to decide for themselves how to manage their licensed allocations, took effect on May 1 and Pereira hasn't caught one fish since. Although he enrolled in a sector, he instead opted to lease his catch allotment, leaving his boat tied up at Leonard's Wharf. He spent last Thursday removing valuable electronics from the wheelhouse. Pereira, 54, owner and captain of the 82-foot New Bedford dragger Blue Seas 2, has been fishing for 34 years, but he will not fish again until May 2011, if at all. ""My major problem was with hake, pollock, witch flounder and dabs,"" he said. In the multi-species New England fishery, his quota for these so called ""choke species"" is so small that once he catches his allocation for any one of them he would have to stop fishing entirely. As a sector member, Pereira can lease his fishing quota to another boat, and that is what he has done. ""The other boat has more horsepower so he can build bigger nets, high-rise nets to catch the haddock, and go in deeper water,"" he said. ""As of now, I'm on unemployment, but fishing is the only thing I know how to do. I made a comfortable living, and that was good enough for me."" Pereira did not disclose how much he was paid for his quota but it was only half of what he could make fishing if the choke species had not prevented him from going out, he said. He let his three regular crew members go, but even at the dock he still has expenses. Insurance is the biggest expense at around $11,000 but he also has to pay dockage fees and will spend around $4,000 on fuel to keep the generators running through the winter. The new rules, intended to rebuild fish populations, replaced an older system that limited the days fishermen could spend at sea. Everyone agreed the days-at-sea model was inefficient, but critics say the new catch shares are both inequitable and poorly conceived. Dr. Brian Rothschild, a professor at UMass Dartmouth's School of Marine Science and Technology, who in 2007 won the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's sustainable fisheries leadership award for his contributions to marine science and education, views sectors unfavorably. ""This is so complicated that I, as a person who modestly keeps track of it, don't understand much of it,"" he said. ""I have 'X' amount of fish this year but I don't know how many pounds I'm going to get next year. Nobody would run a business where today you wake up you have this and tomorrow you don't. That's worse than junk bonds. If a fisherman is cast out of the fishery and then NOAA discovers they made a mistake what happens? If you want to do it, do it right. That's my position and (New Bedford Mayor Scott) Lang's position,"" he added, in reference to the recently filed industry lawsuit, backed by the city, which challenges catch limits. ""From a very fundamental point of view, (NOAA) is doing something that's unlawful,"" Rothschild said. ""The Magnuson Stevens Act says that any fishery management measure needs to take into account the economic and social condition of the community. It's arguable whether an economic analysis has been accomplished and, secondly, the catch share system does nothing but modify the economic and social fabric of the community. If you have something in the plain language of the law that says 'Don't do it' and the agency does it, it's unlawful."" In response to an inquiry from The Standard-Times on the potentially adverse economic impacts of the new system, NOAA communications officer Maggie Mooney-Seus wrote in an e-mail: ""The effects will not be the same for all vessels or all communities. In general, groundfish landings will initially decline over those of recent years if the catch quotas are not exceeded. ... Over the long term, rebuilding groundfish stocks and keeping fishing effort at a sustainable level will support significantly increased landings (approximately three times current landings) and more stability in groundfishing businesses and the communities they support."" Many fishermen, like Pereira, greet such statements with something more than skepticism. ""This boat used to go in and out, buying fuel, ice, groceries,"" he said. ""We bought nets, splices, wire and chains. This is going to hurt welders, painters, electronics people. It's going to be bad for the city."" There is also a toll that is more difficult to quantify. Pereira has owned the Blue Seas 2 for 26 years. He already misses fishing. ""It's in everybody's blood, and that will never go away,"" he said. He can reel off the names of the other New Bedford draggers that have also tied up for the year. ""Neves. Imigrante, Virginia Sands, Voyager, Sao Paulo, Fisherman, Sunshine, Lucimar ..."" The list is a long one, he said. ""The way this is set up, only the big boats are going to survive. I blame National Marine Fisheries. There should be a way for the small and medium boats to make a living."" However, Peter Baker, manager of the New England Fisheries Campaigns for the Pew Environment Group said his group supports sectors. ""New England sectors were initiated to be cooperative and community-based and designed to protect fleet diversity so that small coastal communities like Marshfield and Chatham could have groundfish boats. I think people are beating up on sectors to try to get more fish, but the catch limits are based on science, and you have to draw a clear line between science and sectors. The catch limits would be the same if it were days at sea or sectors."" Without a guarantee that there will be any increase in quota next year, the smaller boat owners are reluctant to invest in a new boat, spend the money to acquire more quota this year or even to perform basic maintenance on their boats. ""Look at this boat,"" Pereira said, pointing to its rust-streaked sides. ""Ask anybody. This boat was always sharp, sharp, sharp. Now my eyes cry."" With quota based on catch history, Pereira says that he is being unfairly penalized for fishing conservatively for the past 10 years. ""I wasn't greedy. I just wanted to make regular trips, spend some time with the family and make a normal living,"" he said. ""The ones who fished the hardest are now getting the benefit."" And it's not like he can just sell off his boat. Nobody is buying draggers given the present circumstances, he says. Another nightmare is looming for the Harbor Development Commission, according to its director Kristin Decas. ""How do we deal with 60 percent of the fleet just being left at our docks?"" she asked. ""This congests the port. And what are we going to do with them? Will they be abandoned? In 2007 we had 18 vessels that were abandoned and it took two years to get rid of those."" There are approximately 457 fishing vessels using the port, split almost evenly between scallopers and draggers. With more than 50 percent of draggers idle, that will result in major congestion problems. But infrastructure is only the surface problem, Decas said. ""These people are heads of households. How will this affect our housing, our school dropout rate? It will impact our communities at a very basic level. That's a big piece of what this lawsuit is about,"" Decas said. Most frustrating to fishermen in all of this, however, are the rigid catch limits. Once an acceptable catch level or ACL is determined, regulators deplete that even further to account for what is described as ""scientific uncertainty."" ""Only 30-40 percent of the allowable catch was taken during the last several years, wasting $300-$400 million in landings a year,"" Rothschild said. ""Only 10 percent of the allowable catch for haddock was caught, and that fish is superabundant. But the constraints on yellowtail and other fish prevent you from catching that. That's why boats are going to go broke because they can't even catch what's biologically allowable. This is a case, and I really believe this, where the federal government has overstepped its bounds in an egregious way. This is a huge story. It's an historic moment for the fishery and for New Bedford.""",2010-06-13

Vessel caught bypassing quota system,Google,East Anglia group sets out long-term plan," That would add 25 or more vessels to the UK fleet, and up to 13,300 additional tonnes of catch per year, creating jobs both offshore and onshore. The total reported value of the catch of commercial species from the southern North Sea has, in recent years, varied between £190m and £260m – but only between 7% and 8% is landed by the UK fleet. Main image: Lowestoft MP Peter Aldous, a member of the REAF group There should be a single management authority in East Anglia to replace current MMO and IFCA management. These are some of the conclusions of a study looking at how to revitalise the fishing industry in East Anglia, which was launched last month. The study has been produced by Renaissance of East Anglian Fisheries (REAF), a community-led group that has come together to produce a long-term strategy for fishing in the region. It points out that although East Anglia sits next to one of the richest fishing regions in Europe, very little local benefit is currently derived from it. Lowestoft MP Peter Aldous, a member of the REAF group, told MPs during a debate on the report: “At present, we have a system that not only brings very little benefit to the East Anglian fishing industry, but is extremely environmentally damaging. “This study’s main finding is that the UK’s departure from the CFP provides a remarkable opportunity to bring about a renaissance of East Anglian fisheries. “However, that will be achieved only if our leaving the EU is accompanied by well-designed national policy and regulation that provide the framework for regional strategies such as REAF.” He said it was vital that zonal attachment, and a requirement to land fish in the UK, are the basis of any future agreement with the EU. Such a change would mean that the UK would benefit by between £28m and £34m from the sevenfold greater allocation of quota stocks from the southern North Sea. This would include an eightfold volume increase in sole, a tenfold increase in herring and an elevenfold increase in plaice. Economic links rules for flagships should be strengthened to promote the landing of fish into UK ports, says REAF. These changes would also benefit jobs and the economy further downstream from the catching sector. Peter Aldous said that while the REAF report is tailored to East Anglia, similar studies could be undertaken to benefit coastal communities anywhere in the country. REAF was formed in 2018 as a partnership between the regional industry, East Suffolk Council, Suffolk County Council, Norfolk County Council, the New Anglia local enterprise partnership, Seafish and Associated British Ports. Funding was provided by the participating councils, Seafish and the EMFF, via the MMO. The REAF strategy makes 11 recommendations, which fall into three categories of change – economic, environmental and regulatory: Peter Aldous stressed that the REAF study is not just academic research, but sets out ‘a range of practical recommendations that, if implemented, could bring significant benefits to local people, communities and businesses’. “We need to get Brexit done, so that we can get on with putting in place strategies such as REAF,” he said. He called for DEFRA to work with the REAF team to start implementing the recommendations, and for ‘seedcorn funding’ for the project. He asked for the pilot scheme on time-at-sea management to replace quotas, that DEFRA has said it will undertake after Brexit, to take place in East Anglia. Also needed were an apprenticeship scheme, and for Lowestoft to ‘regain its crown as the capital of the southern North Sea’ with new facilities, he said. He added that there would also be a need for investment in the processing sector, not just in East Anglia but nationally. Fisheries minister George Eustice welcomed the REAF report and said that he was ready to work with Peter Aldous in the future. On an effort-based pilot scheme, he said that this was sometimes more appropriate for smaller inshore vessels because they have small quotas for a large range of stocks, and ‘a quota system does not work that well for them’. But he added that there were drawbacks, and that a pilot in Ramsgate about seven years ago ‘was not particularly successful’. Nevertheless, “I am open to doing it,” said the minister. Turning to foreign vessels fishing inside the 12-mile limit, and the need for their catches to be landed in the UK, the minister said that after Brexit, the 0-12-mile zone would be ‘predominantly reserved for British vessels, and we will seek to restrict the access of foreign vessels to those waters’. He said that the economic link was under review, and changes could include requiring vessels to land a greater proportion of their catch in the UK. Funding could be provided through the new domestic maritime fund, set up ‘precisely to support fish processing and harbour and port facilities, to help projects such as that under discussion’. On the proposal to combine the MMO and Eastern IFCA to form a regional management authority, George Eustice said that there was a case for their efforts to be ‘more closely’ joined up. The Joint Maritime Operations Co-ordination Centre had been formed so that ‘everybody – from the coastguard to the MMO and IFCAs – can work together to co-ordinate their assets in a single approach to the issue of enforcement’. He supported better management of mixed fisheries, and said that CEFAS in Lowestoft had done some ‘groundbreaking work’. The UK was keen to pursue this approach, he said. With regard to funding, he said he could not give any ‘cast-iron assurances’ that DEFRA would support any application, but guaranteed it would be given ‘full consideration’. Leigh-on-Sea fisherman Paul Gilson is somewhat bemused by the new quotas that have been announced for his part of the Essex coast, reports John Periam. “The announcement of next year’s quotas beggars belief, with three stocks that stick out: spurdog, skate and sole,” he said. “Currently, the area is awash with skate and spurs, to the point that in many areas, it is impossible to fish for sole without filling up with them. Skate is being reduced, and spurs remain closed. “Dover sole, on the other hand, is being increased by 40%, which frankly makes no sense whatsoever. Surely the poor state of the stocks in area 4c is now being passed on. As a result, I am confident that the landing figures will clearly support my claims. You can add to this list the new plaice quota, which has also been increased, when sadly we don’t see the quantity we used to catch in the past.” Paul Gilson has aired his concerns about this issue in the past. “I will say it again – the quota shortage for inshore boats was down to two mistakes, that were never corrected, by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF). The shortage of fish is perhaps more complex, due to the fishing effort, which currently is at an all-time low in the Thames and on the east coast. By this I mean that we should be awash with fish; however, it has all but ceased. The principle of conservation zones works on reduction or cessation of a fishing effort – therefore, the east coast should be seeing an upsurge in stocks, which has not happened other than with skate and spurdog. I also feel we can rule out bass, as this was a fish that has witnessed political interference.” He added: “If we take the scientific advice that the quotas are based on (if it is true and not politically adjusted, as with the bass), we in fact do have a major environmental problem on the east coast, with no abundance of fish, which proves beyond doubt that this fishery is still collapsing. A 40% increase in the sole quota does not relate to what is being seen and caught by the few remaining fishermen who fish in this area.” There have also been concerns regarding dredging in the area, wind farms and seabed cables. These still worry many, and Paul Gilson wonders if enough effort is being made by those involved to bring these issues to the fore. “Conservation is important, and I agree 100% with this. However, if it is going to affect quotas for 2020, we need to be sure that the proposed figures are right. It is hard enough for many of us to make a living now out of fishing, and we need to encourage youngsters to come into this declining industry. If this is the case, let’s get our facts right and get the proposed new quotas set at a level that will work, and please all.” To sign up to our newsletter, please fill in your details below.

Photo by Johnny Bugeja. The Bluefin tuna season will open tomorrow with a 25-tonne quota with the Department of Environment reviewing a mechanism to regulate the commercial sale of locally caught tuna. The total allowable catch has remained the same as last year and the quota will be split in two parts. The first part of the quota has been set at 22 tonnes for the period June 16 to July 25 unless limit is reached beforehand in which case the season will be temporarily closed. The second part of the quota is set at three tonnes and the open season will recommence on August 6 to October 14, 2024. A Government spokesman told the Chronicle that regulation regarding the commercial sale of the
prized fish “is still being reviewed by the Department of the Environment together with partner authorities”. As from Sunday, sports fisherman can catch a tuna a day during open season. Anglers are reminded that a Class K licence is required to fish for Bluefin tuna. A dedicated landing station has been set up within the North Mole (No. 1 Jetty).  Anglers are reminded that all tuna and billfish catches must be reported and weighed at the landing point where vessels will be able to dock. Towing live specimens into the landing station is strictly prohibited and may result in licences being revoked.  The landing point will be manned from 9am to 2.30pm from Monday to Saturday. Any catches landed from 2.30pm to sunset must also be reported and weighed at the landing point by contacting the on-call landing point staff on mobile number: 54020033.  This service will also be operational on Sundays and public holidays. “In order to better assess Bluefin tuna fishing activity in BGTW, landing point staff must be
contacted as soon as a vessel catches a Bluefin tuna,” the Government said. “Details on vessel movements, based on geographical coordinates, may be requested by the DESHCC’s Environmental Protection and Research Unit (EPRU).” “A maximum number of one fish per day per licence holder and vessel will be permitted this year.” “The minimum size of Bluefin tuna that can be caught is 30kgs and 130cm fork length.” “Anglers are also required to report any recreational catches of Billfish species, such as the Mediterranean Swordfish, which are locally classified as Species in Need of Strict Protection.” The minimum size for Mediterranean Swordfish is 90cm excluding the sword length.  Anglers are reminded that the practice of ‘popping’ for tuna, which has been known to cause serious injury to dolphins, will not be allowed inside the Dolphin Protection Zone approximately north of Rosia Bay.  Anglers targeting Bluefin tuna are advised that casting any lines close to dolphins, which are
protected species, may result in their fishing licenses being revoked. The EPRU will be working very closely with marine enforcement agencies during the open season in
order to monitor vessel activity in BGTW and ensure that the requirements of the Tuna Preservation Regulations are adhered to.  As part of its duties, the EPRU will be emphasising the need to adhere to the Cetacean Protocol.  Vessels are required to maintain a minimum distance of 60 metres from any dolphin or whale whilst navigating in BGTW.  The Protocol also establishes a 500-metre radius from the animals within which vessels must travel
at a constant speed of no more than 4 knots or no greater than the slowest animal in the group. The objective of the Protocol is to protect dolphins and whales in BGTW.

Vessel caught bypassing quota system,Bing,Peruvian authorities implement “laughable” fine against Chinese IUU vessel," Search Share    A Chinese vessel caught illegally fishing in Peru’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) has only suffered a small punishment for its actions, with Peruvian authorities fining the infringing vessel PEN 242 (USD 65, EUR 60). The negligible sanction on the Tian Xiang vessel provoked the ire of Peru’s National Society of Artisanal Fishing (Sonapescal), which called the penalty “laughable” and said the fine does not repair the environmental damage caused by the vessel or discourage future vessels from fishing illegally. In 2023, more than 150 foreign vessels entered Peru’s EEZ without using the satellite devices required by Peruvian law for fishing activities; so far this year, the total has reached 35, according to Sonapescal. What makes the situation especially tough to swallow, according to the organization, is that Peruvian officials often charge heavy fines to small-scale fishers caught under the same circumstances. “[Authorities] impose exorbitant fines on artisanal fishermen, initiate criminal proceedings against us, freeze our bank accounts, and confiscate our boats and fishing equipment,” Sonapescal Vice President Edwin Houghton told La República. Peru’s Ministry of Production (PRODUCE), which oversees the country’s fishing activity, has acknowledged the country's fishing regulations need to be revised in order to deter illegal activity. According to Sonapescal, four more foreign ships were improperly authorized to enter Peruvian waters in May, despite not having the proper tracking devices as mandated by supreme decree 016-2016-PRODUCE. All four vessels – Ning Tai 11, Zhou Yu 908, Pu Yuan 827, and Hua Ying 78 – have a history of illegal activity and labor abuse, Sonapescal said. The association has asked the Ministry of Defense and PRODUCE to intensify inspections of foreign vessels entering Peru’s exclusive economic zone. South American countries have had issues with foreign fleets fishing illegally in their national waters for years. The U.S. has recently sought to aid South American governments with deterrence of illegal fishing in the region, which is estimated to cost them and South American companies billions of dollars in revenue annually.    Become a  Premium member to  unlock the rest of this article.

Vessel caught bypassing quota system,Bing,"6 rescued by Coast Guard after boat catches fire, sinks in Lake Tahoe, California sheriff says"," Six people aboard a motorboat in Lake Tahoe were rescued Sunday by the U.S. Coast Guard after the vessel caught fire and sank. Placer County deputies were alerted to the fire about 1:50 p.m. near Cedar Flat, an unincorporated community on Lake Tahoe’s northwest shore. Deputies arrived to the boat — traditionally used for wakeboarding or wake surfing — fully engulfed in flames as heavy smoke billowed across the waters. The passengers aboard were “safe with no major injuries,” the Sheriff’s Office said. Deputies and firefighters with the North Tahoe Fire Protection District sprayed water onto the boat, but its hull suffered too much damage and sank, deputies said on social media. The incident remains under investigation, deputies said.",8 days ago
