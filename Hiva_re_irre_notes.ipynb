To do this, we build language models to try to decipher how the relatively few words you enter into the search box match up to the most useful content available. This involves steps as seemingly simple as recognizing and correcting spelling mistakes, and extends to trying to our sophisticated synonym system that allows us to find relevant documents even if they don't contain the exact words you used.

For example, with webpages, if those keywords appear on the page, or if they appear in the headings or body of the text, the information might be more relevant. Beyond looking at keywords, our systems also analyze if content is relevant to a query in other ways. We also use aggregated and anonymized interaction data to assess whether search results are relevant to queries. \n",
